DSA-491
Several serious problems have been discovered in the Linux kernel.
This update takes care of Linux 2.4.19 for the MIPS architecture.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems that will be fixed with this update:
A vulnerability has been discovered in the R128 DRI driver in the Linux
    kernel which could potentially lead an attacker to gain
    unauthorised privileges.  Alan Cox and Thomas Biege developed a
    correction for this.
Arjan van de Ven discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the
    ncp_lookup function for ncpfs in the Linux kernel, which could
    lead an attacker to gain unauthorised privileges.  Petr Vandrovec
    developed a correction for this.
zen-parse discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
    ISO9660 filesystem component of Linux kernel which could be abused
    by an attacker to gain unauthorised root access.  Sebastian
    Krahmer and Ernie Petrides developed a correction for this.
Solar Designer discovered an information leak in the ext3 code of
    Linux.  In a worst case an attacker could read sensitive data such
    as cryptographic keys which would otherwise never hit disk media.
    Theodore Ts'o developed a correction for this.
Andreas Kies discovered a denial of service condition in the Sound
    Blaster driver in Linux.  He also developed a correction for this.
These problems are also fixed by upstream in Linux 2.4.26 and will be
fixed in Linux 2.6.6.
The following security matrix explains which kernel versions for which
architectures are already fixed and which will be removed instead.
We recommend that you upgrade your kernel packages immediately, either
with a Debian provided kernel or with a self compiled one.

DSA-434
Stefan Esser discovered several security related problems in Gaim, a
multi-protocol instant messaging client.  Not all of them are
applicable for the version in Debian stable, but affected the version
in the unstable distribution at least.  The problems were grouped for
the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures as follows:
When the Yahoo Messenger handler decodes an octal value for email
    notification functions two different kinds of overflows can be
    triggered.  When the MIME decoder decoded a quoted printable
    encoded string for email notification two other different kinds of
    overflows can be triggered.  These problems only affect the
    version in the unstable distribution.
When parsing the cookies within the HTTP reply header of a Yahoo
    web connection a buffer overflow can happen.  When parsing the
    Yahoo Login Webpage the YMSG protocol overflows stack buffers if
    the web page returns oversized values.  When splitting a URL into
    its parts a stack overflow can be caused.  These problems only
    affect the version in the unstable distribution.
When an oversized keyname is read from a Yahoo Messenger packet a
    stack overflow can be triggered.  When Gaim is setup to use an HTTP
    proxy for connecting to the server a malicious HTTP proxy can
    exploit it.  These problems affect all versions Debian ships.
    However, the connection to Yahoo doesn't work in the version in
    Debian stable.
Internally data is copied between two tokens into a fixed size
    stack buffer without a size check.  This only affects the version
    of gaim in the unstable distribution.
When allocating memory for AIM/Oscar DirectIM packets an integer
    overflow can happen, resulting in a heap overflow.  This only
    affects the version of gaim in the unstable distribution.

The authors of phpgroupware, a web based groupware system written in
PHP, discovered several vulnerabilities.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:
In the &quot;calendar&quot; module, &quot;save extension&quot; was not enforced for
  holiday files.  As a result, server-side php scripts may be placed
  in directories that then could be accessed remotely and cause the
  webserver to execute those.  This was resolved by enforcing the
  extension &quot;.txt&quot; for holiday files.
Some SQL injection problems (non-escaping of values used in SQL
  strings) the &quot;calendar&quot; and &quot;infolog&quot; modules.
Additionally, the Debian maintainer adjusted the permissions on world
writable directories that were accidentally created by former postinst
during the installation.

DSA-430
Steve Kemp discovered a problem in trr19, a type trainer application
for GNU Emacs, which is written as a pair of setgid() binaries and
wrapper programs which execute commands for GNU Emacs.  However, the
binaries don't drop privileges before executing a command, allowing an
attacker to gain access to the local group games.

security vulnerability in the memory management code of Linux inside
the mremap(2) system call.  Due to flushing the TLB (Translation
Lookaside Buffer, an address cache) too early it is possible for an
attacker to trigger a local root exploit.
The attack vectors for 2.4.x and 2.2.x kernels are exclusive for the
respective kernel series, though.  We formerly believed that the
exploitable vulnerability in 2.4.x does not exist in 2.2.x which is
still true.  However, it turned out that a second (sort of)
vulnerability is indeed exploitable in 2.2.x, but not in 2.4.x, with a
different exploit, of course.

DSA-465
Two vulnerabilities were discovered in openssl, an implementation of
the SSL protocol, using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool.  More
information can be found in the following &lt;a
href=&quot;http://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2004/224012/index.htm&quot;&gt;NISCC
Vulnerability Advisory&lt;/a&gt; and this &lt;a
href=&quot;http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20040317.txt&quot;&gt;OpenSSL
advisory&lt;/a&gt;.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identified the following vulnerabilities:
Null-pointer assignment in the
   do_change_cipher_spec() function.  A remote attacker could perform
   a carefully crafted SSL/TLS handshake against a server that used
   the OpenSSL library in such a way as to cause OpenSSL to crash.

DSA-455
libxml2 is a library for manipulating XML files.
Yuuichi Teranishi (&amp;#23546;&amp;#35199; &amp;#35029;&amp;#19968;)
discovered a flaw in libxml, the GNOME XML library.
When fetching a remote resource via FTP or HTTP, the library uses
special parsing routines which can overflow a buffer if passed a very
long URL.  If an attacker is able to find an application using libxml1
or libxml2 that parses remote resources and allows the attacker to
craft the URL, then this flaw could be used to execute arbitrary code.

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in wu-ftpd:
Glenn Stewart discovered that users could bypass the
 directory access restrictions imposed by the restricted-gid option by
 changing the permissions on their home directory.  On a subsequent
 login, when access to the user's home directory was denied, wu-ftpd
 would fall back to the root directory.
A buffer overflow existed in wu-ftpd's code which
 deals with S/key authentication.

DSA-458
This security advisory corrects DSA 458-2 which caused a problem in
the gethostbyaddr routine.
The original advisory said:
Sebastian Schmidt discovered a buffer overflow bug in Python's
getaddrinfo function, which could allow an IPv6 address, supplied by a
remote attacker via DNS, to overwrite memory on the stack.
This bug only exists in python 2.2 and 2.2.1, and only when IPv6
support is disabled.  The python2.2 package in Debian woody meets
these conditions (the 'python' package does not).

DSA-468
Ulf HĂ¤rnhammar discovered a number of vulnerabilities in emil, a
filter for converting Internet mail messages.  The vulnerabilities
fall into two categories:
Buffer overflows in (1) the encode_mime function,
   (2) the encode_uuencode function, (3) the decode_uuencode
   function.  These bugs could allow a carefully crafted email message
   to cause the execution of arbitrary code supplied with the message
   when it is acted upon by emil.
Format string bugs in statements which print
   various error messages.  The exploit potential of these bugs has
   not been established, and is probably configuration-dependent.

Max Vozeler discovered two format string vulnerabilities in ssmtp, a
simple mail transport agent.  Untrusted values in the functions die()
and log_event() were passed to printf-like functions as format

Ulf HĂ¤rnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project
discovered a format string
vulnerability in hsftp.  This vulnerability could be exploited by an
attacker able to create files on a remote server with carefully
crafted names, to which a user would connect using hsftp.  When the
user requests a directory listing, particular bytes in memory could be
overwritten, potentially allowing arbitrary code to be executed with
the privileges of the user invoking hsftp.
Note that while hsftp is installed setuid root, it only uses these
privileges to acquire locked memory, and then relinquishes them.

Ulf HĂ¤rnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project
discovered a vulnerability in
synaesthesia, a program which represents sounds visually.
synaesthesia created its configuration file while holding root
privileges, allowing a local user to create files owned by root and
writable by the user's primary group.  This type of vulnerability can
usually be easily exploited to execute arbitrary code with root

DSA-486
Two vulnerabilities have been discovered and fixed in CVS:
Sebastian Krahmer discovered a vulnerability whereby
 a malicious CVS pserver could create arbitrary files on the client
 system during an update or checkout operation, by supplying absolute
 pathnames in RCS diffs.
Derek Robert Price discovered a vulnerability whereby
 a CVS pserver could be abused by a malicious client to view the
 contents of certain files outside of the CVS root directory using
 relative pathnames containing &quot;../&quot;.

DSA-477
Shaun Colley discovered a problem in xine-ui, the xine video player
user interface.  A script contained in the package to possibly remedy
a problem or report a bug does not create temporary files in a secure
fashion.  This could allow a local attacker to overwrite files with
the privileges of the user invoking xine.
This update also removes the bug reporting facility since bug reports
can't be processed upstream anymore.

				<description>The xatitv program in the gatos package does not properly drop root privileges when the configuration file does not exist, which allows local users to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a system call.</description>
				<debian>
					<date>2004-05-29</date>
					<moreinfo>
DSA-509
Steve Kemp discovered a vulnerability in xatitv, one of the programs
in the gatos package, which is used to display video with certain
ATI video cards.
xatitv is installed setuid root in order to gain direct access to the
video hardware.  It normally drops root privileges after successfully
initializing itself.  However, if initialization fails due to a
missing configuration file, root privileges are not dropped, and
xatitv executes the system(3) function to launch its configuration
program without sanitizing user-supplied environment variables.
By exploiting this vulnerability, a local user could gain root
privileges if the configuration file does not exist.  However, a
default configuration file is supplied with the package, and so this
vulnerability is not exploitable unless this file is removed by the
administrator.

DSA-505
Stefan Esser discovered a heap overflow in the CVS server, which
serves the popular Concurrent Versions System.  Malformed &quot;Entry&quot;
Lines in combination with Is-modified and Unchanged can be used to
overflow malloc()ed memory.  This was proven to be exploitable.

				<description>Stack-based buffer overflow in Exim 3.35, and other versions before 4, when the sender_verify option is true, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code during sender verification.</description>

DSA-502
Georgi Guninski discovered two stack-based buffer overflows in exim
and exim-tls.  They cannot be exploited with the default
configuration from the Debian system, though.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems that are fixed with this update:
When &quot;sender_verify = true&quot; is configured in exim.conf a buffer
    overflow can happen during verification of the sender.  This
    problem is fixed in exim 4.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0400&quot;&gt;CAN-2004-0400&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When headers_check_syntax is configured in exim.conf a buffer
    overflow can happen during the header check.  This problem does
    also exist in exim 4.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.35-3woody2.
The unstable distribution (sid) does not contain exim-tls anymore.
The functionality has been incorporated in the main exim versions
which have these problems fixed in version 3.36-11 for exim 3 and in
version 4.33-1 for exim 4.
We recommend that you upgrade your exim-tls package.

DSA-488
Christian Jaeger reported a bug in logcheck which could potentially be
exploited by a local user to overwrite files with root privileges.
logcheck utilized a temporary directory under /var/tmp without taking
security precautions.  While this directory is created when logcheck
is installed, and while it exists there is no vulnerability, if at
any time this directory is removed, the potential for exploitation exists.

DSA-494
Jack &amp;lt;&lt;email &quot;jack@rapturesecurity.org&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; discovered a buffer overflow in
ident2, an implementation of the ident protocol (RFC1413), where a
buffer in the child_service function was slightly too small to hold
all of the data which could be written into it.  This vulnerability
could be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the ident2 daemon (by default, the &quot;identd&quot; user).

DSA-518
iDEFENSE identified a vulnerability in the Opera web browser that
could be used by remote attackers to create or truncate arbitrary
files on the victims machine.  The KDE team discovered that a similar
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20040517-1.txt&quot;&gt;\
vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; exists in KDE.
A remote attacker could entice a user to open a carefully crafted
telnet URI which may either create or truncate a file in the victims
home directory.  In KDE 3.2 and later versions the user is first
explicitly asked to confirm the opening of the telnet URI.

				<description>The Portable Network Graphics library (libpng) 1.0.15 and earlier allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a malformed PNG image file that triggers an error that causes an out-of-bounds read when creating the error message.</description>
				<debian>
					<date>2004-04-30</date>
					<moreinfo>
DSA-498
Steve Grubb discovered a problem in the Portable Network Graphics
library libpng which is utilised in several applications.  When
processing a broken PNG image, the error handling routine will access
memory that is out of bounds when creating an error message.
Depending on machine architecture, bounds checking and other
protective measures, this problem could cause the program to crash if
a defective or intentionally prepared PNG image file is handled by
libpng.
This could be used as a denial of service attack against various
programs that link against this library.  The following commands will
show you which packages utilise this library and whose programs should
probably restarted after an upgrade:
The following security matrix explains which package versions will
contain a correction.
We recommend that you upgrade your libpng and related packages.

DSA-504
Evgeny Demidov discovered a potential buffer overflow in a Kerberos 4
component of heimdal, a free implementation of Kerberos 5.  The
problem is present in kadmind, a server for administrative access to
the Kerberos database.  This problem could perhaps be exploited to
cause the daemon to read a negative amount of data which could lead to
unexpected behaviour.

DSA-620
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Perl, the popular
scripting language.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:
Jeroen van Wolffelaar discovered that the rmtree() function in the
    File::Path module removes directory trees in an insecure manner
    which could lead to the removal of arbitrary files and directories
    through a symlink attack.
Trustix developers discovered several insecure uses of temporary
    files in many modules which allow a local attacker to overwrite
    files via a symlink attack.

DSA-525
Georgi Guninski discovered a buffer overflow bug in Apache's mod_proxy
module, whereby a remote user could potentially cause arbitrary code
to be executed with the privileges of an Apache httpd child process
(by default, user www-data).  Note that this bug is only exploitable
if the mod_proxy module is in use.
Note that this bug exists in a module in the apache-common package,
shared by apache, apache-ssl and apache-perl, so this update is
sufficient to correct the bug for all three builds of Apache httpd.
However, on systems using apache-ssl or apache-perl, httpd will not
automatically be restarted.

Four vulnerabilities were discovered in squirrelmail:
Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
 in SquirrelMail 1.4.2 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
 script as other users and possibly steal authentication information
 via multiple attack vectors, including the mailbox parameter in
 compose.php.
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in mime.php
 for SquirrelMail before 1.4.3 allows remote attackers to insert
 arbitrary HTML and script via the content-type mail header, as
 demonstrated using read_body.php.
SQL injection vulnerability in SquirrelMail before
 1.4.3 RC1 allows remote attackers to execute unauthorized SQL
 statements, with unknown impact, probably via abook_database.php.
Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
 in Squirrelmail 1.2.10 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject
 arbitrary HTML or script via (1) the $mailer variable in
 read_body.php, (2) the $senderNames_part variable in
 mailbox_display.php, and possibly other vectors including (3) the
 $event_title variable or (4) the $event_text variable.

A buffer overflow has been discovered in the ODBC driver of PostgreSQL,
an object-relational SQL database, descended from POSTGRES.  It is possible
to exploit this problem and crash the surrounding application.  Hence, a
PHP script using php4-odbc can be utilised to crash the surrounding
Apache webserver.  Other parts of postgresql are not affected.

DSA-669
Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in php4 which also apply to
the version of php3 in the stable Debian distribution.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:
The memory_limit functionality allows remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary code under certain circumstances.
The strip_tags function does not filter null (\0) characters
    within tag names when restricting input to allowed tags, which
    allows dangerous tags to be processed by some web browsers which
    could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
DSA-531
Two vulnerabilities were discovered in php4:
The memory_limit functionality in PHP 4.x up to
   4.3.7, and 5.x up to 5.0.0RC3, under certain conditions such as
   when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to
   execute arbitrary code by triggering a memory_limit abort during
   execution of the zend_hash_init function and overwriting a
   HashTable destructor pointer before the initialization of key data
   structures is complete.
The strip_tags function in PHP 4.x up to 4.3.7, and
   5.x up to 5.0.0RC3, does not filter null (\0) characters within tag
   names when restricting input to allowed tags, which allows
   dangerous tags to be processed by web browsers such as Internet
   Explorer and Safari, which ignore null characters and facilitate
   the exploitation of cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

				<description>Multiple buffer overflows in libpng 1.2.5 and earlier, as used in multiple products, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via malformed PNG images in which (1) the png_handle_tRNS function does not properly validate the length of transparency chunk (tRNS) data, or the (2) png_handle_sBIT or (3) png_handle_hIST functions do not perform sufficient bounds checking.</description>

DSA-536
Chris Evans discovered several vulnerabilities in libpng:
Multiple buffer overflows exist, including when
 handling transparency chunk data, which could be exploited to cause
 arbitrary code to be executed when a specially crafted PNG image is
 processed
Multiple NULL pointer dereferences in
 png_handle_iCPP() and elsewhere could be exploited to cause an
 application to crash when a specially crafted PNG image is processed
Multiple integer overflows in the png_handle_sPLT(),
 png_read_png() functions and elsewhere could be exploited to cause an
 application to crash, or potentially arbitrary code to be executed,
 when a specially crafted PNG image is processed
In addition, a bug related to &lt;a href=&quot;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1363&quot;&gt;CAN-2002-1363&lt;/a&gt; was fixed:
A buffer overflow could be caused by incorrect
 calculation of buffer offsets, possibly leading to the execution of
 arbitrary code

The MIT Kerberos Development Team has discovered a number of
vulnerabilities in the MIT Kerberos Version 5 software.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:
A double-free error may allow unauthenticated remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary code on KDC or clients.
Several double-free errors may allow authenticated attackers to
    execute arbitrary code on Kerberos application servers.
A remotely exploitable denial of service vulnerability has been
    found in the KDC and libraries.
Several double-free errors may allow remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary code on the server.  This does not affect the version in
    woody.

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in recent versions of Qt, a
commonly used graphic widget set, used in KDE for example.  The first
problem allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, while the other
two only seem to pose a denial of service danger.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:
Chris Evans has discovered a heap-based overflow when handling
    8-bit RLE encoded BMP files.
Marcus Meissner has discovered a crash condition in the XPM
    handling code, which is not yet fixed in Qt 3.3.
Marcus Meissner has discovered a crash condition in the GIF
    handling code, which is not yet fixed in Qt 3.3.

DSA-775
A vulnerability has been discovered in Mozilla and Mozilla Firefox
that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary Javascript from one
page into the frameset of another site.  Thunderbird is not affected
by this and Galeon will be automatically fixed as it uses Mozilla
components.
The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain Mozilla Firefox
packages.

page into the frameset of another site.  Thunderbird is not affected
by this and Galeon will be automatically fixed as it uses Mozilla
components.
DSA-810
Several problems have been discovered in Mozilla, the web browser of
the Mozilla suite.  Since the usual praxis of backporting apparently
does not work for this package, this update is basically version
1.7.10 with the version number rolled back, and hence still named
1.7.8.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:
A vulnerability has been discovered in Mozilla that allows remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary Javascript from one page into the
    frameset of another site.
The browser user interface does not properly distinguish between
    user-generated events and untrusted synthetic events, which makes
    it easier for remote attackers to perform dangerous actions that
    normally could only be performed manually by the user.
XML scripts ran even when Javascript disabled.
It is possible for a remote attacker to execute a callback
    function in the context of another domain (i.e. frame).
Missing input sanitising of InstallVersion.compareTo() can cause
    the application to crash.
Remote attackers could steal sensitive information such as cookies
    and passwords from web sites by accessing data in alien frames.
It is possible for a Javascript dialog box to spoof a dialog box
    from a trusted site and facilitates phishing attacks.
Remote attackers could modify certain tag properties of DOM nodes
    that could lead to the execution of arbitrary script or code.
The Mozilla browser family does not properly clone base objects,
    which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

				<description>The BMP image processor for (1) gdk-pixbuf before 0.22 and (2) gtk2 before 2.2.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted BMP file.</description>

DSA-546
Chris Evans discovered several problems in gdk-pixbuf, the GdkPixBuf
library used in Gtk.  It is possible for an attacker to execute
arbitrary code on the victims machine.  Gdk-pixbuf for Gtk+1.2 is an
external package.  For Gtk+2.0 it's part of the main gtk package.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project identifies the
following vulnerabilities:
Denial of service in bmp loader.
Heap-based overflow in pixbuf_create_from_xpm.
Integer overflow in the ico loader.

				<description>The FileStore capability in CGI::Session for Ruby before 1.8.1, and possibly PStore, creates files with insecure permissions, which can allow local users to steal session information and hijack sessions.</description>
				<debian>
					<date>2004-08-16</date>
					<moreinfo>
DSA-537
Andres Salomon noticed a problem in the CGI session management of
Ruby, an object-oriented scripting language.  CGI::Session's FileStore
(and presumably PStore, but not in Debian woody) implementations store
session information insecurely.  They simply create files, ignoring
permission issues.  This can lead an attacker who has also shell
access to the webserver to take over a session.

DSA-549
Chris Evans discovered several problems in gdk-pixbuf, the GdkPixBuf
library used in Gtk.  It is possible for an attacker to execute
arbitrary code on the victims machine.  Gdk-pixbuf for Gtk+1.2 is an
external package.  For Gtk+2.0 it's part of the main gtk package.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project identifies the
following vulnerabilities:
Heap-based overflow in pixbuf_create_from_xpm.
Stack-based overflow in xpm_extract_color.
Integer overflow in the ico loader.

				<description>Directory traversal vulnerability in the sanitize_path function in util.c for rsync 2.6.2 and earlier, when chroot is disabled, allows attackers to read or write certain files.</description>

DSA-538
The rsync developers have discovered a security related problem in
rsync, a fast remote file copy program, which offers an attacker to
access files outside of the defined directory.  To exploit this
path-sanitizing bug, rsync has to run in daemon mode with the chroot
option being disabled.  It does not affect the normal send/receive
filenames that specify what files should be transferred.  It does
affect certain option paths that cause auxiliary files to be read or
written.

				<description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the RLE (run length encoding) decoders for libtiff 3.6.1 and earlier, related to buffer overflows and integer overflows, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via TIFF files.</description>
				<debian>

DSA-567
Several problems have been discovered in libtiff, the Tag Image File
Format library for processing TIFF graphics files.  An attacker could
prepare a specially crafted TIFF graphic that would cause the client
to execute arbitrary code or crash.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures Project has identified the following problems:
Chris Evans discovered several problems in the RLE (run length
    encoding) decoders that could lead to arbitrary code execution.
Matthias Clasen discovered a division by zero through an integer
    overflow.
Dmitry V. Levin discovered several integer overflows that caused
    malloc issues which can result to either plain crash or memory
    corruption.

DSA-568
A vulnerability has been discovered in the Cyrus implementation of the
SASL library, the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method
for adding authentication support to connection-based protocols.  The
library honors the environment variable SASL_PATH blindly, which
allows a local user to link against a malicious library to run
arbitrary code with the privileges of a setuid or setgid application.
The MIT version of the Cyrus implementation of the SASL library 
provides bindings against MIT GSSAPI and MIT Kerberos4.
DSA-563
This advisory is an addition to DSA 563-1 and 563-2 which weren't able
to supersede the library on sparc and arm due to a different version
number for them in the stable archive. Other architectures were
updated properly. Another problem was reported in connection with
sendmail, though, which should be fixed with this update as well.

DSA-1018
 The original update lacked recompiled ALSA modules against the new kernel
ABI. Furthermore, kernel-latest-2.4-sparc now correctly depends on the
updated packages. For completeness we're providing the original problem description:

Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:
Martin Schwidefsky discovered that the privileged instruction SACF (Set
    Address Space Control Fast) on the S/390 platform is not handled properly, 
    allowing for a local user to gain root privileges.
A race condition allows for a local user to read the environment variables
    of another process that is still spawning through /proc/.../cmdline.
A numeric casting discrepancy in sdla_xfer allows local users to read
    portions of kernel memory via a large len argument which is received as an
    int but cast to a short, preventing read loop from filling a buffer.
An error in the skb_checksum_help() function from the netfilter framework
    has been discovered that allows the bypass of packet filter rules or
    a denial of service attack.
A vulnerability in the ptrace subsystem of the IA-64 architecture can 
    allow local attackers to overwrite kernel memory and crash the kernel.
Tim Yamin discovered that insufficient input validation in the compressed
    ISO file system (zisofs) allows a denial of service attack through
    maliciously crafted ISO images.
Herbert Xu discovered that the setsockopt() function was not restricted to
    users/processes with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability. This allows attackers to
    manipulate IPSEC policies or initiate a denial of service attack.
Al Viro discovered a race condition in the /proc handling of network devices.
    A (local) attacker could exploit the stale reference after interface shutdown
    to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code in kernel mode.
Tetsuo Handa discovered that the udp_v6_get_port() function from the IPv6 code
    can be forced into an endless loop, which allows a denial of service attack.
Rudolf Polzer discovered that the kernel improperly restricts access to the
    KDSKBSENT ioctl, which can possibly lead to privilege escalation.
The ptrace code using CLONE_THREAD didn't use the thread group ID to
    determine whether the caller is attaching to itself, which allows a denial
    of service attack.
Yen Zheng discovered that the IPv6 flow label code modified an incorrect variable,
    which could lead to memory corruption and denial of service.
Ollie Wild discovered a memory leak in the icmp_push_reply() function, which
    allows denial of service through memory consumption.
Chris Wright discovered that excessive allocation of broken file lock leases
    in the VFS layer can exhaust memory and fill up the system logging, which allows
    denial of service.
Patrick McHardy discovered a memory leak in the ip6_input_finish() function from
    the IPv6 code, which allows denial of service.
Yi Ying discovered that sysctl does not properly enforce the size of a
    buffer, which allows a denial of service attack.
The following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture
fix the problems mentioned above:
The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:
We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.
This update introduces a change in the kernel's binary interface, the affected
kernel packages inside Debian have been rebuilt, if you're running local addons
you'll need to rebuild these as well.

				<description>telnetd for netkit 0.17 and earlier, and possibly other versions, on Debian GNU/Linux allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (free of an invalid pointer), a different vulnerability than CVE-2001-0554.</description>

					<moreinfo>
DSA-569
Michal Zalewski discovered a bug in the netkit-telnet server (telnetd)
whereby a remote attacker could cause the telnetd process to free an
invalid pointer.  This causes the telnet server process to crash,
leading to a straightforward denial of service (inetd will disable the
service if telnetd is crashed repeatedly), or possibly the execution
of arbitrary code with the privileges of the telnetd process (by
default, the 'telnetd' user).

Haris Sehic discovered several vulnerabilities in viewcvs, a utility
for viewing CVS and Subversion repositories via HTTP.  When exporting
a repository as a tar archive the hide_cvsroot and forbidden settings
were not honoured enough.
When upgrading the package for woody, please make a copy of your
/etc/viewcvs/viewcvs.conf file if you have manually edited this file.
Upon upgrade the debconf mechanism may alter it in a way so that
viewcvs doesn't understand it anymore.

DSA-566
An information leak has been detected in CUPS, the Common UNIX
Printing System, which may lead to the disclosure of sensitive
information, such as user names and passwords which are written into
log files.
The used patch only eliminates the authentication information in the
device URI which is logged in the error_log file.  It does not
eliminate the URI from the environment and process table, which is why
the CUPS developers recommend that system administrators do not code
authentication information in device URIs in the first place.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in unarj, a non-free ARJ
unarchive utility.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:
A buffer overflow has been discovered when handling long file
    names contained in an archive.  An attacker could create a
    specially crafted archive which could cause unarj to crash or
    possibly execute arbitrary code when being extracted by a victim.
A directory traversal vulnerability has been found so that an
    attacker could create a specially crafted archive which would
    create files in the parent directory when being extracted by a
    victim.  When used recursively, this vulnerability could be used
    to overwrite critical system files and programs.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in MySQL, a popular
database.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:
Sergei Golubchik discovered a problem in the access handling for
    similar named databases.  If a user is granted privileges to a
    database with a name containing an underscore (&quot;_&quot;), the user also
    gains privileges to other databases with similar names.
Stefano Di Paola discovered that MySQL allows remote
    authenticated users with INSERT and DELETE privileges to execute
    arbitrary code by using CREATE FUNCTION to access libc calls.
Stefano Di Paola discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated
    users with INSERT and DELETE privileges to bypass library path
    restrictions and execute arbitrary libraries by using INSERT INTO
    to modify the mysql.func table.
Stefano Di Paola discovered that MySQL uses predictable file names
   when creating temporary tables, which allows local users with
   CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE privileges to overwrite arbitrary files via
   a symlink attack.

a GNU/Linux system.  Trustix developers found that the catchsegv
script uses temporary files insecurely.  Openwall developers
discovered insecure temporary files in the glibcbug script.  These
scripts are vulnerable to a symlink attack.

1/2/3 audio player.  If a user opened a malicious playlist or URL, an
attacker might execute arbitrary code with the rights of the calling
user.

				<description>Multiple integer overflows in xzgv 0.8 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via images with large width and height values, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow, as demonstrated in the read_prf_file function in readprf.c.  NOTE: CVE-2004-0994 and CVE-2004-1095 identify sets of bugs that only partially overlap, despite having the same developer.  Therefore, they should be regarded as distinct.</description>

DSA-639
Andrew V. Samoilov has noticed that several bugfixes which were
applied to the source by upstream developers of mc, the midnight
commander, a file browser and manager, were not backported to the
current version of mc that Debian ships in their stable release.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:
Multiple format string vulnerabilities
Multiple buffer overflows
One infinite loop vulnerability
Denial of service via  corrupted section header
Denial of service via null dereference
Freeing unallocated memory
Denial of service via use of already freed memory
Denial of service via manipulating non-existing file handles
Unintended program execution via insecure filename quoting
Denial of service via a buffer underflow

				<description>Buffer overflow in Info-Zip 2.3 and possibly earlier versions, when using recursive folder compression, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a ZIP file containing a long pathname.</description>
				<debian>

DSA-624
A buffer overflow has been discovered in zip, the archiver for .zip
files.  When doing recursive folder compression the program did not
check the resulting path length, which would lead to memory being
overwritten.  A malicious person could convince a user to create an
archive containing a specially crafted path name, which could lead to
the execution of arbitrary code.

DSA-1017
Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:
Multiple overflows exist in the io_edgeport driver which might be usable
    as a denial of service attack vector.
Bryan Fulton reported a bounds checking bug in the coda_pioctl function
    which may allow local users to execute arbitrary code or trigger a denial
    of service attack.
An error in the skb_checksum_help() function from the netfilter framework
    has been discovered that allows the bypass of packet filter rules or
    a denial of service attack.
Tim Yamin discovered that insufficient input validation in the zisofs driver
    for compressed ISO file systems allows a denial of service attack through
    maliciously crafted ISO images.
A buffer overflow in the sendmsg() function allows local users to execute
    arbitrary code.
Herbert Xu discovered that the setsockopt() function was not restricted to
    users/processes with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability. This allows attackers to
    manipulate IPSEC policies or initiate a denial of service attack. 
Al Viro discovered a race condition in the /proc handling of network devices.
    A (local) attacker could exploit the stale reference after interface shutdown
    to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code in kernel mode.
Jan Blunck discovered that repeated failed reads of /proc/scsi/sg/devices
    leak memory, which allows a denial of service attack.
Tetsuo Handa discovered that the udp_v6_get_port() function from the IPv6 code
    can be forced into an endless loop, which allows a denial of service attack.
Vasiliy Averin discovered that the reference counters from sockfd_put() and 
    fput() can be forced into overlapping, which allows a denial of service attack
    through a null pointer dereference.
Eric Dumazet discovered that the set_mempolicy() system call accepts a negative
    value for its first argument, which triggers a BUG() assert. This allows a
    denial of service attack.
Harald Welte discovered that if a process issues a USB Request Block (URB)
    to a device and terminates before the URB completes, a stale pointer
    would be dereferenced.  This could be used to trigger a denial of service
    attack.
Pavel Roskin discovered that the driver for Orinoco wireless cards clears
    its buffers insufficiently. This could leak sensitive information into
    user space.
Robert Derr discovered that the audit subsystem uses an incorrect function to
    free memory, which allows a denial of service attack.
Rudolf Polzer discovered that the kernel improperly restricts access to the
    KDSKBSENT ioctl, which can possibly lead to privilege escalation.
Doug Chapman discovered that the mq_open syscall can be tricked into
    decrementing an internal counter twice, which allows a denial of service attack
    through a kernel panic.
Doug Chapman discovered that passing a zero bitmask to the set_mempolicy()
    system call leads to a kernel panic, which allows a denial of service attack.
The ptrace code using CLONE_THREAD didn't use the thread group ID to
    determine whether the caller is attaching to itself, which allows a denial
    of service attack.
The auto-reaping of child processes functionality included ptraced-attached
    processes, which allows denial of service through dangling references.
Yen Zheng discovered that the IPv6 flow label code modified an incorrect variable,
    which could lead to memory corruption and denial of service.
It was discovered that a threaded real-time process, which is currently dumping
    core can be forced into a dead-lock situation by sending it a SIGKILL signal,
    which allows a denial of service attack. 
Ollie Wild discovered a memory leak in the icmp_push_reply() function, which
    allows denial of service through memory consumption.
Chris Wright discovered that excessive allocation of broken file lock leases
    in the VFS layer can exhaust memory and fill up the system logging, which allows
    denial of service.
Patrick McHardy discovered a memory leak in the ip6_input_finish() function from
    the IPv6 code, which allows denial of service.
Karl Janmar discovered that a signedness error in the procfs code can be exploited
    to read kernel memory, which may disclose sensitive information.
Yi Ying discovered that sysctl does not properly enforce the size of a buffer, which
    allows a denial of service attack.
Stefan Rompf discovered that dm_crypt does not clear an internal struct before freeing
    it, which might disclose sensitive information.
It was discovered that the SDLA driver's capability checks were too lax
    for firmware upgrades.
Ludovic Courtes discovered that get_compat_timespec() performs insufficient input
    sanitizing, which allows a local denial of service attack.
It was discovered that ptrace() on the ia64 architecture allows a local denial of
    service attack, when preemption is enabled.
The following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture
fix the problems mentioned above:
The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:
We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.
This update introduces a change in the kernel's binary interface, the affected
kernel packages inside Debian have been rebuilt, if you're running local addons
you'll need to rebuild these as well. Due to the change in the package
name you need to use &lt;tt&gt;apt-get dist-upgrade&lt;/tt&gt; to update your system.

Liam Helmer noticed that sudo, a program that provides limited super
user privileges to specific users, does not clean the environment
sufficiently.  Bash functions and the CDPATH variable are still passed
through to the program running as privileged user, leaving
possibilities to overload system routines.  These vulnerabilities can
only be exploited by users who have been granted limited super user

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in gallery, a web-based
photo album written in PHP4.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following vulnerabilities:
Jim Paris discovered a cross site scripting vulnerability which
    allows code to be inserted by using specially formed URLs.
The upstream developers of gallery have fixed several cases of
    possible variable injection that could trick gallery to unintended
    actions, e.g. leaking database passwords.

DSA-701
It has been discovered that the last security update for Samba, a
LanManager like file and printer server for GNU/Linux and Unix-like
systems caused the daemon to crash upon reload. This has been fixed.
For reference below is the original advisory text:
Greg MacManus discovered an integer overflow in the smb daemon from
Samba, a LanManager like file and printer server for GNU/Linux and
Unix-like systems.  Requesting a very large number of access control
descriptors from the server could exploit the integer overflow, which
may result in a buffer overflow which could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code with root privileges.  Upstream developers have
discovered more possible integer overflows that are fixed with this
update as well.

				<description>Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the driver script in mailman before 2.1.5 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a URL, which is not properly escaped in the resulting error page.</description>
				<debian>
					<date>2005-02-21</date>
					<moreinfo>
DSA-674
Due to an incompatibility between Python 1.5 and 2.1 the last mailman
update did not run with Python 1.5 anymore.  This problem is corrected
with this update.  This advisory only updates the packages updated
with DSA 674-2.  The version in unstable is not affected since it is
not supposed to work with Python 1.5 anymore.  For completeness below
is the original advisory text:
Two security related problems have been discovered in mailman,
web-based GNU mailing list manager.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:
Florian Weimer discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability in
    mailman's automatically generated error messages.  An attacker
    could craft a URL containing JavaScript (or other content
    embedded into HTML) which triggered a mailman error page that
    would include the malicious code verbatim.
Several listmasters have noticed unauthorised access to archives
    of private lists and the list configuration itself, including the
    users passwords.  Administrators are advised to check the
    webserver logfiles for requests that contain &quot;/...../&quot; and the
    path to the archives or configuration.  This does only seem to
    affect installations running on web servers that do not strip
    slashes, such as Apache 1.3.

Patrice Fournier discovered a vulnerability in the authorisation
subsystem of hylafax, a flexible client/server fax system.  A local or
remote user guessing the contents of the hosts.hfaxd database could
gain unauthorised access to the fax system.
Some installations of hylafax may actually utilise the weak hostname
and username validation for authorized uses.  For example, hosts.hfaxd
entries that may be common are
After updating, these entries will need to be modified in order to
continue to function.  Respectively, the correct entries should be

				<description>The EPSF pipe support in enscript 1.6.3 allows remote attackers or local users to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters.</description>
				<debian>
					<date>2005-01-21</date>
					<moreinfo>
DSA-654
Erik SjĂślund has discovered several security relevant problems in
enscript, a program to convert ASCII text into Postscript and other
formats.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following vulnerabilities:
Unsanitised input can cause the execution of arbitrary commands
    via EPSF pipe support.  This has been disabled, also upstream.
Due to missing sanitising of filenames it is possible that a
    specially crafted filename can cause arbitrary commands to be
    executed.
Multiple buffer overflows can cause the program to crash.
Usually, enscript is only run locally, but since it is executed inside
of viewcvs some of the problems mentioned above can easily be turned
into a remote vulnerability.

DSA-659
Two problems have been discovered in the libpam-radius-auth package,
the PAM RADIUS authentication module.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures Project identifies the following problems:
The Debian package accidentally installed its configuration file
    /etc/pam_radius_auth.conf world-readable.  Since it may possibly
    contain secrets all local users are able to read them if the
    administrator hasn't adjusted file permissions.  This problem is
    Debian specific.
Leon Juranic discovered an integer underflow in the mod_auth_radius
    module for Apache which is also present in libpam-radius-auth.

DSA-715
Several problems have been discovered in the CVS server, which serves
the popular Concurrent Versions System.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:
Maks Polunin and Alberto Garcia discovered independently that
    using the pserver access method in connection with the repouid
    patch that Debian uses it is possible to bypass the password and
    gain access to the repository in question.
Alberto Garcia discovered that a remote user can cause the cvs
    server to crash when the cvs-repouids file exists but does not
    contain a mapping for the current repository, which can be used as
    a denial of service attack.

DSA-657
A heap overflow has been discovered in the DVD subpicture decoder of
xine-lib.  An attacker could cause arbitrary code to be executed on
the victims host by supplying a malicious MPEG.  By tricking users to
view a malicious network stream, this is remotely exploitable.

DSA-1076

Browser, is not able to grok invalid HTML including a TEXTAREA tag
with a large COLS value and a large tag name in an element that is not
terminated, and loops forever trying to render the broken HTML.
DSA-1077
Michal Zalewski discovered that lynx, the popular text-mode WWW
Browser, is not able to grok invalid HTML including a TEXTAREA tag
with a large COLS value and a large tag name in an element that is not
terminated, and loops forever trying to render the broken HTML.  The
same code is present in lynx-ssl.
DSA-1085
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in lynx, the popular
text-mode WWW browser.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
Project identifies the following vulnerabilities:
Michal Zalewski discovered that lynx is not able to grok invalid
    HTML including a TEXTAREA tag with a large COLS value and a large
    tag name in an element that is not terminated, and loops forever
    trying to render the broken HTML.
Ulf HĂ¤rnhammar discovered a buffer overflow that can be remotely
    exploited. During the handling of Asian characters when connecting
    to an NNTP server lynx can be tricked to write past the boundary
    of a buffer which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

DSA-980
Joxean Koret discovered several security problems in tutos, a web-based
team organization software. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project
identifies the following problems:
An SQL injection vulnerability allows the execution of SQL commands
     through the link_id parameter in file_overview.php.
Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerabilities in the search function of the
     address book and in app_new.php allow the execution of web script
     code.
The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain tutos packages.

DSA-922
Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the
Linux kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of
arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:
A race condition in the sysfs filesystem allows local users to
    read kernel memory and cause a denial of service (crash).
Alexander Nyberg discovered that the ptrace() system call does not
    properly verify addresses on the amd64 architecture which can be
    exploited by a local attacker to crash the kernel.
A problem in the offset handling in the xattr file system code for
    ext3 has been discovered that may allow users on 64-bit systems
    that have access to an ext3 filesystem with extended attributes to
    cause the kernel to crash.
Chris Wright discovered that the mmap() function could create
    illegal memory maps that could be exploited by a local user to
    crash the kernel or potentially execute arbitrary code.
A vulnerability on the IA-64 architecture can lead local attackers
    to overwrite kernel memory and crash the kernel.
A vulnerability has been discovered in the ptrace() system call on
    the amd64 architecture that allows a local attacker to cause the
    kernel to crash.
A buffer overflow in the ptrace system call for 64-bit
    architectures allows local users to write bytes into arbitrary
    kernel memory.
Zou Nan Hai has discovered that a local user could cause the
    kernel to hang on the amd64 architecture after invoking syscall()
    with specially crafted arguments.
A vulnerability has been discovered in the stack segment fault
    handler that could allow a local attacker to cause a stack exception
    that will lead the kernel to crash under certain circumstances.
Balazs Scheidler discovered that a local attacker could call
    setsockopt() with an invalid xfrm_user policy message which would
    cause the kernel to write beyond the boundaries of an array and
    crash.
Vladimir Volovich discovered a bug in the zlib routines which are
    also present in the Linux kernel and allows remote attackers to
    crash the kernel.
Another vulnerability has been discovered in the zlib routines
    which are also present in the Linux kernel and allows remote
    attackers to crash the kernel.
Peter Sandstrom noticed that snmpwalk from a remote host could
    cause a denial of service (kernel oops from null dereference) via
    certain UDP packets that lead to a function call with the wrong
    argument.
Andreas Gruenbacher discovered a bug in the ext2 and ext3 file
    systems.  When data areas are to be shared among two inodes not
    all information were compared for equality, which could expose
    wrong ACLs for files.
Chad Walstrom discovered that the ipt_recent kernel module on
    64-bit processors such as AMD64 allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (kernel panic) via certain attacks such as SSH
    brute force.
The mprotect code on Itanium IA-64 Montecito processors does not
    properly maintain cache coherency as required by the architecture,
    which allows local users to cause a denial of service and possibly
    corrupt data by modifying PTE protections.
A race condition in the thread management may allow local users to
    cause a denial of service (deadlock) when threads are sharing
    memory and waiting for a thread that has just performed an exec.
When one thread is tracing another thread that shares the same
    memory map a local user could cause a denial of service (deadlock)
    by forcing a core dump when the traced thread is in the
    TASK_TRACED state.
A bug in the ioremap() system call has been discovered on the
    amd64 architecture that could allow local users to cause a
    denial of service or an information leak when performing a lookup
    of a non-existent memory page.
The HFS and HFS+ (hfsplus) modules allow local attackers to cause
    a denial of service (oops) by using hfsplus to mount a filesystem
    that is not hfsplus.
A race condition in the ebtables netfilter module on an SMP system
    running under high load may allow remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (crash).
Roland McGrath discovered that exec() does not properly clear
    posix-timers in multi-threaded environments, which results in a
    resource leak and could allow a large number of multiple local
    users to cause a denial of service by using more posix-timers than
    specified by the quota for a single user.
The kernel allows remote attackers to poison the bridge forwarding
    table using frames that have already been dropped by filtering,
    which can cause the bridge to forward spoofed packets.
The ioctl for the packet radio ROSE protocol does not properly
    verify the arguments when setting a new router, which allows
    attackers to trigger out-of-bounds errors.
A race condition on SMP systems allows local users to cause a
    denial of service (null dereference) by causing a connection timer
    to expire while the connection table is being flushed before the
    appropriate lock is acquired.
An error in the NAT code allows remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption) by causing two packets for the same
    protocol to be NATed at the same time, which leads to memory
    corruption.
A missing memory cleanup in the thread handling routines before
    copying data into userspace allows a user process to obtain
    sensitive information.
This update also contains a number of corrections for issues that
turned out to have no security implication afterwards.
The following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture
fix the problems mentioned above:
We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and
reboot the machine.

DSA-1064
Jason Duell discovered that cscope, a source code browsing tool, does not
verify the length of file names sourced in include statements, which may
potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code through specially
crafted source code files.

DSA-1184
This advisory covers the S/390 components of the recent security
update for the Linux 2.6.8 kernel that were missing due to technical
problems. For reference, please see the text of the original advisory.
Several security related problems have been discovered in the Linux
kernel which may lead to a denial of service or even the execution of
arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:
Toshihiro Iwamoto discovered a memory leak in the handling of
    direct I/O writes that allows local users to cause a denial of
    service.
A buffer overflow in NFS readlink handling allows a malicious
    remote server to cause a denial of service.
Stephen Smalley discovered a bug in the SELinux ptrace handling
    that allows local users with ptrace permissions to change the
    tracer SID to the SID of another process.
Pavel Kankovsky discovered an information leak in the getsockopt
    system call which can be exploited by a local program to leak
    potentially sensitive memory to userspace.
Douglas Gilbert reported a bug in the sg driver that allows local
    users to cause a denial of service by performing direct I/O
    transfers from the sg driver to memory mapped I/O space.
Mattia Belletti noticed that certain debugging code left in the
    process management code could be exploited by a local attacker to
    cause a denial of service.
Kostik Belousov discovered a missing LSM file_permission check in
    the readv and writev functions which might allow attackers to
    bypass intended access restrictions.
Patrick McHardy discovered a bug in the SNMP NAT helper that
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service.
A race condition in the socket buffer handling allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service.
Diego Calleja Garcia discovered a buffer overflow in the DVD
    handling code that could be exploited by a specially crafted DVD
    USB storage device to execute arbitrary code.
A bug in the serial USB driver has been discovered that could be
    exploited by a custom made USB serial adapter to consume arbitrary
    amounts of memory.
James McKenzie discovered a denial of service vulnerability in the
    NFS driver.  When exporting an ext3 file system over NFS, a remote
    attacker could exploit this to trigger a file system panic by
    sending a specially crafted UDP packet.
Wei Wang discovered a bug in the SCTP implementation that allows
    local users to cause a denial of service and possibly gain root
    privileges.
Olof Johansson discovered that the kernel does not disable the HID0
    bit on PowerPC 970 processors which could be exploited by a local
    attacker to cause a denial of service.
A bug in the Universal Disk Format (UDF) filesystem driver could
    be exploited by a local user to cause a denial of service.
David Miller reported a problem with the fix for &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3745&quot;&gt;CVE-2006-3745&lt;/a&gt;
    that allows local users to crash the system via an SCTP
    socket with a certain SO_LINGER value.
The following matrix explains which kernel version for which
architecture fixes the problem mentioned above:

DSA-1503
Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:
infamous41md reported multiple integer overflows in the Sbus PROM
    driver that would allow for a DoS (Denial of Service) attack by a
    local user, and possibly the execution of arbitrary code.
Doug Chapman discovered a potential local DoS (deadlock) in the mincore
    function caused by improper lock handling.
Eric Sandeen provided a fix for a local memory corruption vulnerability
    resulting from a misinterpretation of return values when operating on
    inodes which have been marked bad.
LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted cramfs filesystem.
LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext3 filesystem.
LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext2 filesystem.
Marcel Holtman discovered multiple buffer overflows in the Bluetooth
    subsystem which can be used to trigger a remote DoS (crash) and potentially
    execute arbitrary code.
Ilja van Sprundel discovered that kernel memory could be leaked via the
    Bluetooth setsockopt call due to an uninitialized stack buffer. This
    could be used by local attackers to read the contents of sensitive kernel
    memory.
Masayuki Nakagawa discovered that flow labels were inadvertently
    being shared between listening sockets and child sockets. This defect
    can be exploited by local users to cause a DoS (Oops).
Thomas Graf reported a typo in the DECnet protocol handler that could
    be used by a local attacker to overrun an array via crafted packets,
    potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (system crash).
    A similar issue exists in the IPV4 protocol handler and will be fixed
    in a subsequent update.
Florian Zumbiehl discovered a memory leak in the PPPOE subsystem caused
    by releasing a socket before PPPIOCGCHAN is called upon it. This could
    be used by a local user to DoS a system by consuming all available memory.
Wojciech Purczynski discovered that pdeath_signal was not being reset
    properly under certain conditions which may allow local users to gain
    privileges by sending arbitrary signals to suid binaries.
Alan Cox reported an issue in the aacraid driver that allows unprivileged
    local users to make ioctl calls which should be restricted to admin
    privileges.
PaX team discovered an issue in the random driver where a defect in the
    reseeding code leads to a reduction in entropy.
Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam
    devices. If the device is removed while a userspace application has it
    open, the driver will wait for userspace to close the device, resulting
    in a blocked USB subsystem. This issue is of low security impact as
    it requires the attacker to either have physical access to the system
    or to convince a user with local access to remove the device on their
    behalf.
Venustech AD-LAB discovered a a buffer overflow in the isdn ioctl
    handling, exploitable by a local user.
ADLAB discovered a possible memory overrun in the ISDN subsystem that
    may permit a local user to overwrite kernel memory by issuing
    ioctls with unterminated data.
Blake Frantz discovered that when a core file owned by a non-root user
    exists, and a root-owned process dumps core over it, the core file
    retains its original ownership. This could be used by a local user to
    gain access to sensitive information.
Cyrill Gorcunov reported a NULL pointer dereference in code specific
    to the CHRP PowerPC platforms. Local users could exploit this issue
    to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS).
Nick Piggin of SuSE discovered a number of issues in subsystems which
    register a fault handler for memory mapped areas. This issue can be
    exploited by local users to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS) and possibly
    execute arbitrary code.
The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:
We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.

				<description>sshd in OpenSSH 3.5p1, when PermitRootLogin is disabled, immediately closes the TCP connection after a root login attempt with the correct password, but leaves the connection open after an attempt with an incorrect password, which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess the password by observing the connection state, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0190.  NOTE: it could be argued that in most environments, this does not cross privilege boundaries without requiring leverage of a separate vulnerability.</description>

				<description>The expand function in fio.c in Heirloom mailx 12.5 and earlier and BSD mailx 8.1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in an email address.</description>

DSA-3105
Two security vulnerabilities were discovered in Heirloom mailx, an 
implementation of the &lt;q&gt;mail&lt;/q&gt; command:
mailx interprets shell meta-characters in certain email
    addresses.
An unexpected feature of mailx treats syntactically valid email
    addresses as shell commands to execute.
Shell command execution can be re-enabled using the &lt;q&gt;expandaddr&lt;/q&gt;
option.
Note that this security update does not remove all mailx facilities
for command execution, though.  Scripts which send mail to addresses
obtained from an untrusted source (such as a web form) should use the
&lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; separator before the email addresses (which was fixed to work
properly in this update), or they should be changed to invoke
&lt;code&gt;mail -t&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;sendmail -i -t&lt;/code&gt; instead, passing the recipient addresses
as part of the mail header.
