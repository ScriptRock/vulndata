				<description>KDC in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5kdc) does not set a global variable for some krb4 message types, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted messages that trigger a NULL pointer dereference or double-free.</description>

DSA-1524
Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the kdc component
of the krb5, a system for authenticating users and services on a
network. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the 
following problems:
An unauthenticated remote attacker may cause a krb4-enabled KDC to
crash, expose information, or execute arbitrary code.  Successful
exploitation of this vulnerability could compromise the Kerberos key
database and host security on the KDC host.
An unauthenticated remote attacker may cause a krb4-enabled KDC to
expose information.  It is theoretically possible for the exposed
information to include secret key data on some platforms.
An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause memory corruption in the
kadmind process, which is likely to cause kadmind to crash, resulting in
a denial of service. It is at least theoretically possible for such
corruption to result in database corruption or arbitrary code execution,
though we have no such exploit and are not aware of any such exploits in
use in the wild.  In versions of MIT Kerberos shipped by Debian, this
bug can only be triggered in configurations that allow large numbers of
open file descriptors in a process.

DSA-1468
Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:
Olaf Kock discovered that HTTPS encryption was insufficiently
    enforced for single-sign-on cookies, which could result in
    information disclosure.
It was discovered that the Manager and Host Manager web applications
    performed insufficient input sanitising, which could lead to cross site
    scripting.
This update also adapts the tomcat5.5-webapps package to the tightened
JULI permissions introduced in the previous tomcat5.5 DSA. However, it
should be noted, that the tomcat5.5-webapps is for demonstration and
documentation purposes only and should not be used for production
systems.
The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain tomcat5.5.

DSA-1576
The recently announced vulnerability in Debian's openssl package
(&lt;a href=&quot;/security/2008/dsa-1571&quot;&gt;DSA-1571-1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0166&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-0166&lt;/a&gt;) indirectly affects OpenSSH.  As a result,
all user and host keys generated using broken versions of the openssl
package must be considered untrustworthy, even after the openssl update
has been applied.
1. Install the security updates
This update contains a dependency on the openssl update and will
   automatically install a corrected version of the libssl0.9.8 package,
   and a new package openssh-blacklist.
Once the update is applied, weak user keys will be automatically
   rejected where possible (though they cannot be detected in all
   cases).  If you are using such keys for user authentication, they
   will immediately stop working and will need to be replaced (see
   step 3).
OpenSSH host keys can be automatically regenerated when the OpenSSH
   security update is applied.  The update will prompt for confirmation
   before taking this step.
2. Update OpenSSH known_hosts files
The regeneration of host keys will cause a warning to be displayed when
   connecting to the system using SSH until the host key is updated in the
   known_hosts file.  The warning will look like this:
In this case, the host key has simply been changed, and you should update
   the relevant known_hosts file as indicated in the error message.
   
   It is recommended that you use a trustworthy channel to exchange the
   server key.  It is found in the file /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub on
   the server; it's fingerprint can be printed using the command:
ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
In addition to user-specific known_hosts files, there may be a
   system-wide known hosts file /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.  This is file is
   used both by the ssh client and by sshd for the hosts.equiv
   functionality.  This file needs to be updated as well.
3. Check all OpenSSH user keys
The safest course of action is to regenerate all OpenSSH user keys,
   except where it can be established to a high degree of certainty that the
   key was generated on an unaffected system.
Check whether your key is affected by running the ssh-vulnkey tool, included
   in the security update.  By default, ssh-vulnkey will check the standard
   location for user keys (~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa and ~/.ssh/identity),
   your authorized_keys file (~/.ssh/authorized_keys and
   ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2), and the system's host keys
   (/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key and /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key).
To check all your own keys, assuming they are in the standard
   locations (~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, or ~/.ssh/identity):
ssh-vulnkey
To check all keys on your system:
sudo ssh-vulnkey -a
To check a key in a non-standard location:
ssh-vulnkey /path/to/key
If ssh-vulnkey says &quot;Unknown (no blacklist information)&quot;, then it has no
   information about whether that key is affected.  In this case, you
   can examine the modification time (mtime) of the file using &quot;ls -l&quot;.
   Keys generated before September 2006 are not affected.  Keep in mind
   that, although unlikely, backup procedures may have changed the file
   date back in time (or the system clock may have been incorrectly
   set).
   
   If in doubt, generate a new key and remove the old one from any
   servers.
4. Regenerate any affected user keys
OpenSSH keys used for user authentication must be manually regenerated,
   including those which may have since been transferred to a different system
   after being generated.
New keys can be generated using ssh-keygen, e.g.:
5. Update authorized_keys files (if necessary)
Once the user keys have been regenerated, the relevant public keys
   must be propagated to any authorized_keys files (and authorized_keys2
   files, if applicable) on remote systems.  Be sure to delete the lines
   containing old keys from those files.
In addition to countermeasures to mitigate the randomness vulnerability,
this OpenSSH update fixes several other vulnerabilities:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1483&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-1483&lt;/a&gt;:
   Timo Juhani Lindfors discovered that, when using X11 forwarding, the
   SSH client selects an X11 forwarding port without ensuring that it
   can be bound on all address families. If the system is configured
   with IPv6 (even if it does not have working IPv6 connectivity), this
   could allow a local attacker on the remote server to hijack X11
   forwarding.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4752&quot;&gt;CVE-2007-4752&lt;/a&gt;:
   Jan Pechanec discovered that ssh falls back to creating a trusted X11
   cookie if creating an untrusted cookie fails, potentially exposing
   the local display to a malicious remote server when using X11
   forwarding.
DSA-1571
Luciano Bello discovered that the random number generator in Debian's
openssl package is predictable.  This is caused by an incorrect
Debian-specific change to the openssl package (&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0166&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-0166&lt;/a&gt;).  As a
result, cryptographic key material may be guessable.
This is a Debian-specific vulnerability which does not affect other
operating systems which are not based on Debian.  However, other systems
can be indirectly affected if weak keys are imported into them.
It is strongly recommended that all cryptographic key material which has
been generated by OpenSSL versions starting with 0.9.8c-1 on Debian
systems is recreated from scratch.  Furthermore, all DSA keys ever used
on affected Debian systems for signing or authentication purposes should
be considered compromised; the Digital Signature Algorithm relies on a
secret random value used during signature generation.
The first vulnerable version, 0.9.8c-1, was uploaded to the unstable
distribution on 2006-09-17, and has since that date propagated to the testing and
current stable (etch) distributions.  The old stable distribution
(sarge) is not affected.
Affected keys include SSH keys, OpenVPN keys, DNSSEC keys, and key
material for use in X.509 certificates and session keys used in SSL/TLS
connections.  Keys generated with GnuPG or GNUTLS are not affected,
though.
A detector for known weak key material will be published at:
&lt;url &quot;http://security.debian.org/project/extra/dowkd/dowkd.pl.gz&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://security.debian.org/project/extra/dowkd/dowkd.pl.gz.asc&quot;&gt;(OpenPGP signature)&lt;/a&gt;
Instructions how to implement key rollover for various packages will be
published at:
&lt;a href=&quot;$(HOME)/security/key-rollover/&quot;&gt;https://www.debian.org/security/key-rollover/&lt;/a&gt;
This web site will be continuously updated to reflect new and updated
instructions on key rollovers for packages using SSL certificates.
Popular packages not affected will also be listed.
In addition to this critical change, two other vulnerabilities have been
fixed in the openssl package which were originally scheduled for release
with the next etch point release: OpenSSL's DTLS (Datagram TLS,
basically &lt;q&gt;SSL over UDP&lt;/q&gt;) implementation did not actually implement the
DTLS specification, but a potentially much weaker protocol, and
contained a vulnerability permitting arbitrary code execution
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4995&quot;&gt;CVE-2007-4995&lt;/a&gt;).  A side channel attack in the integer multiplication
routines is also addressed (&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3108&quot;&gt;CVE-2007-3108&lt;/a&gt;).

				<description>Heap-based buffer overflow in Mozilla Thunderbird before 2.0.0.12 and SeaMonkey before 1.1.8 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted external-body MIME type in an e-mail message, related to an incorrect memory allocation during message preview.</description>

DSA-1621

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Icedove
mail client, an unbranded version of the Thunderbird client. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:


    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in MIME decoding can lead
    to the execution of arbitrary code.
    

    It was discovered that missing boundary checks on a reference
    counter for CSS objects can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
    

    Devon Hubbard, Jesse Ruderman and Martijn Wargers discovered
    crashes in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of
    arbitrary code.
    

    Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman and Gary Kwong discovered crashes in
    the Javascript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.
    

    &quot;moz_bug_r_a4&quot; discovered that XUL documents can escalate
    privileges by accessing the pre-compiled &quot;fastload&quot; file.
    

    &quot;moz_bug_r_a4&quot; discovered that missing input sanitising in the
    mozIJSSubScriptLoader.loadSubScript() function could lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code. Iceweasel itself is not affected, but
    some addons are.
    

    Daniel Glazman discovered that a programming error in the code for
    parsing .properties files could lead to memory content being
    exposed to addons, which could lead to information disclosure.
    

    John G. Myers, Frank Benkstein and Nils Toedtmann discovered that
    alternate names on self-signed certificates were handled
    insufficiently, which could lead to spoofings secure connections.
    

    Greg McManus discovered discovered a crash in the block reflow
    code, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.
    

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.0.13+1.5.0.15b.dfsg1+prepatch080614d-0etch1.
Packages for s390 are not yet available and will be provided later.


For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.16-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your icedove package.

Multiple security problems have been discovered in the Firebird database,
which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.


This Debian security advisory is a bit unusual. While it's normally 
our strict policy to backport security bugfixes to older releases, this
turned out to be infeasible for Firebird 1.5 due to large infrastructural
changes necessary to fix these issues. As a consequence security support
for Firebird 1.5 is hereby discontinued, leaving two options to
administrators running a Firebird database:

DSA-1484
Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a
runtime environment for XUL applications. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:
Jesse Ruderman, Kai Engert, Martijn Wargers, Mats Palmgren and Paul
    Nickerson discovered crashes in the layout engine, which might allow
    the execution of arbitrary code.
Carsten Book, Wesley Garland, Igor Bukanov, &lt;q&gt;moz_bug_r_a4&lt;/q&gt;, &lt;q&gt;shutdown&lt;/q&gt;,
    Philip Taylor and &lt;q&gt;tgirmann&lt;/q&gt; discovered crashes in the JavaScript
    engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.
&lt;q&gt;hong&lt;/q&gt; and Gregory Fleischer discovered that file input focus
    vulnerabilities in the file upload control could allow information
    disclosure of local files.
&lt;q&gt;moz_bug_r_a4&lt;/q&gt; and Boris Zbarsky discovered several
    vulnerabilities in JavaScript handling, which could allow
    privilege escalation.
Justin Dolske discovered that the password storage mechanism could
    be abused by malicious web sites to corrupt existing saved passwords.
Gerry Eisenhaur and &lt;q&gt;moz_bug_r_a4&lt;/q&gt; discovered that a directory
    traversal vulnerability in chrome: URI handling could lead to
    information disclosure.
David Bloom discovered a race condition in the image handling of
    designMode elements, which could lead to information disclosure or
    potentially the execution of arbitrary code.
Michal Zalewski discovered that timers protecting security-sensitive
    dialogs (which disable dialog elements until a timeout is reached)
    could be bypassed by window focus changes through JavaScript.
It was discovered that malformed content declarations of saved
    attachments could prevent a user from opening local files
    with a &lt;q&gt;.txt&lt;/q&gt; file name, resulting in minor denial of service.
Martin Straka discovered that insecure stylesheet handling during
    redirects could lead to information disclosure.
Emil Ljungdahl and Lars-Olof Moilanen discovered that phishing
    protections could be bypassed with &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; elements.
The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain xulrunner.

				<description>modules/libpr0n/decoders/bmp/nsBMPDecoder.cpp in Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.12, Thunderbird before 2.0.0.12, and SeaMonkey before 1.1.8 does not properly perform certain calculations related to the mColors table, which allows remote attackers to read portions of memory uninitialized via a crafted 8-bit bitmap (BMP) file that triggers an out-of-bounds read within the heap, as demonstrated using a CANVAS element; or cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted 8-bit bitmap file that triggers an out-of-bounds read.

DSA-1496
Several buffer overflows have been discovered in the MPlayer movie player,
which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:
Felipe Manzano and Anibal Sacco discovered a buffer overflow in
    the demuxer for MOV files.
Reimar Doeffinger discovered a buffer overflow in the FLAC header
    parsing.
Adam Bozanich discovered a buffer overflow in the CDDB access code.
Adam Bozanich discovered a buffer overflow in URL parsing.
The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain mplayer.

				<description>wml_backend/p1_ipp/ipp.src in Website META Language (WML) 2.0.11 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the ipp.$$.tmp temporary file.</description>
				<debian>
					<date>2008-02-10</date>
					<moreinfo>
DSA-1492
Frank Lichtenheld and Nico Golde discovered that WML, an off-line HTML
generation toolkit, creates insecure temporary files in the eperl and
ipp backends and in the wmg.cgi script, which could lead to a local denial
of service by overwriting files.
The old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected.

following problems:
Ian Jackson discovered that range checks of file operations on 
    emulated disk devices were insufficiently enforced.
It was discovered that an error in the format auto detection of
    removable media could lead to the disclosure of files in the
    host system.
A buffer overflow has been found in the emulation of the Cirrus
    graphics adaptor.

DSA-1526
Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit project discovered several local
vulnerabilities in xwine, a graphical user interface for the WINE emulator.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:
The xwine command makes unsafe use of local temporary files when
  printing.  This could allow the removal of arbitrary files belonging
  to users who invoke the program.
The xwine command changes the permissions of the global WINE configuration
  file such that it is world-writable.  This could allow local users to edit
  it such that arbitrary commands could be executed whenever any local user
  executed a program under WINE.

DSA-1663
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in NET SNMP, a suite of
Simple Network Management Protocol applications. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:
Wes Hardaker reported that the SNMPv3 HMAC verification relies on
    the client to specify the HMAC length, which allows spoofing of
    authenticated SNMPv3 packets.
John Kortink reported a buffer overflow in the __snprint_value
    function in snmp_get causing a denial of service and potentially
    allowing the execution of arbitrary code via a large OCTETSTRING 
    in an attribute value pair (AVP).
It was reported that an integer overflow in the
    netsnmp_create_subtree_cache function in agent/snmp_agent.c allows   
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service attack via a crafted  
    SNMP GETBULK request.

Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd,
a fast webserver with minimal memory footprint.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the 
following problems:
lighttpd 1.4.18, and possibly other versions before 1.5.0, does not
  properly calculate the size of a file descriptor array, which allows 
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a large number 
  of connections, which triggers an out-of-bounds access. 
connections.c in lighttpd before 1.4.16 might accept more connections 
  than the configured maximum, which allows remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service (failed assertion) via a large number of connection
  attempts.

				<description>Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in MoinMoin 1.5.8 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) certain input processed by formatter/text_gedit.py (aka the gui editor formatter); (2) a page name, which triggers an injection in PageEditor.py when the page is successfully deleted by a victim in a DeletePage action; or (3) the destination page name for a RenamePage action, which triggers an injection in PageEditor.py when a victim's rename attempt fails because of a duplicate name.  NOTE: the AttachFile XSS issue is already covered by CVE-2008-0781, and the login XSS issue is already covered by CVE-2008-0780.</description>

				<description>Stack-based buffer overflow in the imb_loadhdr function in Blender 2.45 allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a .blend file that contains a crafted Radiance RGBE image.</description>
				<debian>
					<date>2008-05-05</date>
					<moreinfo>
DSA-1567
Stefan Cornelius discovered a vulnerability in the Radiance High
Dynamic Range (HDR) image parser in Blender, a 3D modelling
application.  The weakness could enable a stack-based buffer overflow
and the execution of arbitrary code if a maliciously-crafted HDR file
is opened, or if a directory containing such a file is browsed via
Blender's image-open dialog.

				<description>phpMyAdmin before 2.11.5 accesses $_REQUEST to obtain some parameters instead of $_GET and $_POST, which allows attackers in the same domain to override certain variables and conduct SQL injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by using crafted cookies.</description>

DSA-1557
Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin,
an application to administrate MySQL over the WWW. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:
Attackers with CREATE table permissions were allowed to read
    arbitrary files readable by the webserver via a crafted
    HTTP POST request.
The PHP session data file stored the username and password of
    a logged in user, which in some setups can be read by a local
    user.
Cross site scripting and SQL injection were possible by attackers
    that had permission to create cookies in the same cookie domain
    as phpMyAdmin runs in.

				<debian>
					<date>2008-03-14</date>
					<moreinfo>
DSA-1516
Prior to this update, the default configuration for Dovecot used by
Debian runs the server daemons with group mail privileges.  This means
that users with write access to their mail directory on the server
(for example, through an SSH login) could read and also delete via a symbolic link mailboxes owned by
other users for which they do not have direct access
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1199&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-1199&lt;/a&gt;).  In addition, an internal interpretation conflict in
password handling has been addressed proactively, even though it is
not known to be exploitable (&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1218&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-1218&lt;/a&gt;).
Note that applying this update requires manual action: The
configuration setting &lt;q&gt;mail_extra_groups = mail&lt;/q&gt; has been replaced
with &lt;q&gt;mail_privileged_group = mail&lt;/q&gt;.  The update will show a
configuration file conflict in /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf.  It is
recommended that you keep the currently installed configuration file,
and change the affected line.  For your reference, the sample
configuration (without your local changes) will have been written to
/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf.dpkg-new.
If your current configuration uses &lt;code&gt;mail_extra_groups&lt;/code&gt; with a value
different from &lt;q&gt;mail&lt;/q&gt;, you may have to resort to the
&lt;code&gt;mail_access_groups&lt;/code&gt; configuration directive.

DSA-1574
Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Icedove mail
client, an unbranded version of the Thunderbird client.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:
&lt;q&gt;moz_bug_r_a4&lt;/q&gt; discovered that variants of &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3738&quot;&gt;CVE-2007-3738&lt;/a&gt; and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5338&quot;&gt;CVE-2007-5338&lt;/a&gt; allow the execution of arbitrary code through
    XPCNativeWrapper.
&lt;q&gt;moz_bug_r_a4&lt;/q&gt; discovered that insecure handling of event
    handlers could lead to cross-site scripting.
Boris Zbarsky, Johnny Stenback and &lt;q&gt;moz_bug_r_a4&lt;/q&gt; discovered
    that incorrect principal handling could lead to cross-site
    scripting and the execution of arbitrary code.
Tom Ferris, Seth Spitzer, Martin Wargers, John Daggett and Mats
    Palmgren discovered crashes in the layout engine, which might
    allow the execution of arbitrary code.
&lt;q&gt;georgi&lt;/q&gt;, &lt;q&gt;tgirmann&lt;/q&gt; and Igor Bukanov discovered crashes in the
    Javascript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary
    code.

				<description>gcc 4.3.x does not generate a cld instruction while compiling functions used for string manipulation such as memcpy and memmove on x86 and i386, which can prevent the direction flag (DF) from being reset in violation of ABI conventions and cause data to be copied in the wrong direction during signal handling in the Linux kernel, which might allow context-dependent attackers to trigger memory corruption.

				<description>The (1) SProcRecordCreateContext and (2) SProcRecordRegisterClients functions in the Record extension and the (3) SProcSecurityGenerateAuthorization function in the Security extension in the X server 1.4 in X.Org X11R7.3 allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via requests with crafted length values that specify an arbitrary number of bytes to be swapped on the heap, which triggers heap corruption.</description>

DSA-1595
Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X Window system.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:
Lack of validation of the parameters of the
    SProcSecurityGenerateAuthorization and SProcRecordCreateContext
    functions makes it possible for a specially crafted request to trigger
    the swapping of bytes outside the parameter of these requests, causing
    memory corruption.
An integer overflow in the validation of the parameters of the
    ShmPutImage() request makes it possible to trigger the copy of
    arbitrary server memory to a pixmap that can subsequently be read by
    the client, to read arbitrary parts of the X server memory space.
An integer overflow may occur in the computation of the size of the
    glyph to be allocated by the AllocateGlyph() function which will cause
    less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to later heap
    overflow.
An integer overflow may occur in the computation of the  size of the
    glyph to be allocated by the ProcRenderCreateCursor() function which
    will cause less memory to be allocated than expected, leading later
    to dereferencing un-mapped memory, causing a crash of the X server.
Integer overflows can also occur in the code validating the parameters
    for the SProcRenderCreateLinearGradient, SProcRenderCreateRadialGradient
    and SProcRenderCreateConicalGradient functions, leading to memory
    corruption by swapping bytes outside of the intended request
    parameters.

DSA-2058
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GNU C Library (aka
glibc) and its derivatives. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures 
project identifies the following problems:
Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the GNU C library did not
    correctly handle integer overflows in the strfmon family of 
    functions. If a user or automated system were tricked into 
    processing a specially crafted format string, a remote attacker 
    could crash applications, leading to a denial of service.
Jeff Layton and Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did
    not correctly handle newlines in the mntent family of functions. If
    a local attacker were able to inject newlines into a mount entry 
    through other vulnerable mount helpers, they could disrupt the 
    system or possibly gain root privileges.
Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did not correctly
    validate certain ELF program headers.  If a user or automated system
    were tricked into verifying a specially crafted ELF program, a 
    remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

DSA-1591
Several local (remote) vulnerabilities have been discovered in libvorbis,
a library for the Vorbis general-purpose compressed audio codec. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:
libvorbis does not properly handle a zero value which allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or infinite loop) or
    trigger an integer overflow.
Integer overflow in libvorbis allows remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary code via a crafted OGG file, which triggers a heap overflow.
Integer overflow in libvorbis allows remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted OGG file
    which triggers a heap overflow.

				<description>The DNS protocol, as implemented in (1) BIND 8 and 9 before 9.5.0-P1, 9.4.2-P1, and 9.3.5-P1; (2) Microsoft DNS in Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, and Server 2003 SP1 and SP2; and other implementations allow remote attackers to spoof DNS traffic via a birthday attack that uses in-bailiwick referrals to conduct cache poisoning against recursive resolvers, related to insufficient randomness of DNS transaction IDs and source ports, aka &quot;DNS Insufficient Socket Entropy Vulnerability&quot; or &quot;the Kaminsky bug.&quot;</description>

DSA-1605
Dan Kaminsky discovered that properties inherent to the DNS protocol
lead to practical DNS spoofing and cache poisoning attacks.  Among
other things, successful attacks can lead to misdirected web traffic
and email rerouting.
At this time, it is not possible to implement the recommended
countermeasures in the GNU libc stub resolver.  The following
workarounds are available:
1. Install a local BIND 9 resolver on the host, possibly in
forward-only mode.  BIND 9 will then use source port randomization
when sending queries over the network.  (Other caching resolvers can
be used instead.)
2. Rely on IP address spoofing protection if available.  Successful
attacks must spoof the address of one of the resolvers, which may not
be possible if the network is guarded properly against IP spoofing
attacks (both from internal and external sources).
This DSA will be updated when patches for hardening the stub resolver
are available.
DSA-1623
Dan Kaminsky discovered that properties inherent to the DNS protocol
lead to practical DNS cache poisoning attacks. Among other things,
successful attacks can lead to misdirected web traffic and email
rerouting.
This update changes Debian's dnsmasq packages to implement the
recommended countermeasure: UDP query source port randomization. This
change increases the size of the space from which an attacker has to
guess values in a backwards-compatible fashion and makes successful
attacks significantly more difficult.
This update also switches the random number generator to Dan
Bernstein's SURF.
DSA-1617

In DSA-1603-1, Debian released an update to the BIND 9 domain name
server, which introduced UDP source port randomization to mitigate
the threat of DNS cache poisoning attacks (identified by the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project as &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1447&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-1447&lt;/a&gt;).
The fix, while correct, was incompatible with the version of SELinux Reference
Policy shipped with Debian Etch, which did not permit a process running in the
named_t domain to bind sockets to UDP ports other than the standard 'domain'
port (53).
The incompatibility affects both the 'targeted' and 'strict' policy packages
supplied by this version of refpolicy.


This update to the refpolicy packages grants the ability to bind to
arbitrary UDP ports to named_t processes.
When installed, the updated packages will attempt to update the bind policy
module on systems where it had been previously loaded and where the previous
version of refpolicy was 0.0.20061018-5 or below.


Because the Debian refpolicy packages are not yet designed with policy module
upgradeability in mind, and because SELinux-enabled Debian systems often have
some degree of site-specific policy customization, it is difficult to assure
that the new bind policy can be successfully upgraded.
To this end, the package upgrade will not abort if the bind policy update
fails.
The new policy module can be found at
/usr/share/selinux/refpolicy-targeted/bind.pp after installation.
Administrators wishing to use the bind service policy can reconcile any policy
incompatibilities and install the upgrade manually thereafter.
A more detailed discussion of the corrective procedure may be found on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.debian.org/SELinux/Issues/BindPortRandomization&quot;&gt;https://wiki.debian.org/SELinux/Issues/BindPortRandomization&lt;/a&gt;.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.0.20061018-5.1+etch1.


The unstable distribution (sid) is not affected, as subsequent refpolicy
releases have incorporated an analogous change.


We recommend that you upgrade your refpolicy packages.

DSA-1603
Dan Kaminsky discovered that properties inherent to the DNS protocol
lead to practical DNS cache poisoning attacks.  Among other things,
successful attacks can lead to misdirected web traffic and email
rerouting.
This update changes Debian's BIND 9 packages to implement the
recommended countermeasure: UDP query source port randomization.  This
change increases the size of the space from which an attacker has to
guess values in a backwards-compatible fashion and makes successful
attacks significantly more difficult.
Note that this security update changes BIND network behavior in a
fundamental way, and the following steps are recommended to ensure a
smooth upgrade.
1. Make sure that your network configuration is compatible with source
port randomization.  If you guard your resolver with a stateless packet
filter, you may need to make sure that no non-DNS services listen on
the 1024--65535 UDP port range and open it at the packet filter.  For
instance, packet filters based on etch's Linux 2.6.18 kernel only
support stateless filtering of IPv6 packets, and therefore pose this
additional difficulty.  (If you use IPv4 with iptables and ESTABLISHED
rules, networking changes are likely not required.)
2. Install the BIND 9 upgrade, using &quot;apt-get update&quot; followed by
&quot;apt-get install bind9&quot;.  Verify that the named process has been
restarted and answers recursive queries.  (If all queries result in
timeouts, this indicates that networking changes are necessary; see the
first step.)
3. Verify that source port randomization is active.  Check that the
/var/log/daemon.log file does not contain messages of the following
form
right after the &quot;listening on IPv6 interface&quot; and &quot;listening on IPv4
interface&quot; messages logged by BIND upon startup.  If these messages are
present, you should remove the indicated lines from the configuration,
or replace the port numbers contained within them with &quot;*&quot; sign (e.g.,
replace &quot;port 53&quot; with &quot;port *&quot;).
For additional certainty, use tcpdump or some other network monitoring
tool to check for varying UDP source ports.  If there is a NAT device
in front of your resolver, make sure that it does not defeat the
effect of source port randomization.
4. If you cannot activate source port randomization, consider
configuring BIND 9 to forward queries to a resolver which can, possibly
over a VPN such as OpenVPN to create the necessary trusted network link.
(Use BIND's forward-only mode in this case.)
Other caching resolvers distributed by Debian (PowerDNS, MaraDNS,
Unbound) already employ source port randomization, and no updated
packages are needed.  BIND 9.5 up to and including version
1:9.5.0.dfsg-4 only implements a weak form of source port
randomization and needs to be updated as well.  For information on
BIND 8, see &lt;a href=&quot;dsa-1604&quot;&gt;DSA-1604-1&lt;/a&gt;, and for the status of
the libc stub resolver, see &lt;a href=&quot;dsa-1605&quot;&gt;DSA-1605-1&lt;/a&gt;.
The updated bind9 packages contain changes originally scheduled for
the next stable point release, including the changed IP address of
L.ROOT-SERVERS.NET (Debian bug #&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.debian.org/449148&quot;&gt;449148&lt;/a&gt;).
DSA-1604
Dan Kaminsky discovered that properties inherent to the DNS protocol
lead to practical DNS cache poisoning attacks.  Among other things,
successful attacks can lead to misdirected web traffic and email
rerouting.
The BIND 8 legacy code base could not be updated to include the
recommended countermeasure (source port randomization, see
&lt;a href=&quot;dsa-1603&quot;&gt;DSA-1603-1&lt;/a&gt;
for details).  There are two ways to deal with this situation:
1. Upgrade to BIND 9 (or another implementation with source port
randomization).  The documentation included with BIND 9 contains a
migration guide.
2. Configure the BIND 8 resolver to forward queries to a BIND 9
resolver.  Provided that the network between both resolvers is trusted,
this protects the BIND 8 resolver from cache poisoning attacks (to the
same degree that the BIND 9 resolver is protected).
This problem does not apply to BIND 8 when used exclusively as an
authoritative DNS server.  It is theoretically possible to safely use
BIND 8 in this way, but updating to BIND 9 is strongly recommended.
BIND 8 (that is, the bind package) will be removed from the etch
distribution in a future point release.
DSA-1619
Multiple weaknesses have been identified in PyDNS, a DNS client
implementation for the Python language.  Dan Kaminsky identified a
practical vector of DNS response spoofing and cache poisoning,
exploiting the limited entropy in a DNS transaction ID and lack of
UDP source port randomization in many DNS implementations.  Scott
Kitterman noted that python-dns is vulnerable to this predictability,
as it randomizes neither its transaction ID nor its source port.
Taken together, this lack of entropy leaves applications using
python-dns to perform DNS queries highly susceptible to response
forgery.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this
class of weakness as &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1447&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-1447&lt;/a&gt;
and this specific instance in PyDNS as &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4099&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-4099&lt;/a&gt;.

DSA-1586
Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in xine-lib, a library
which supplies most of the application functionality of the xine
multimedia player.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following three problems:
Integer overflow vulnerabilities exist in xine's FLV, QuickTime,
    RealMedia, MVE and CAK demuxers, as well as the EBML parser used
    by the Matroska demuxer.  These weaknesses allow an attacker to
    overflow heap buffers and potentially execute arbitrary code by
    supplying a maliciously crafted file of those types.
Insufficient input validation in the Speex implementation used
    by this version of xine enables an invalid array access and the
    execution of arbitrary code by supplying a maliciously crafted
    Speex file.
Inadequate bounds checking in the NES Sound Format (NSF) demuxer
    enables a stack buffer overflow and the execution of arbitrary
    code through a maliciously crafted NSF file.

DSA-1655
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, privilege escalation or a leak of
sensitive data. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:
Jan Kratochvil reported a local denial of service vulnerability in
    the ptrace interface for the s390 architecture. Local users can
    trigger an invalid pointer dereference, leading to a system panic.
Eugene Teo reported a lack of capability checks in the kernel
    driver for Granch SBNI12 leased line adapters (sbni), allowing
    local users to perform privileged operations.
Olaf Kirch discovered an issue with the i915 driver that may allow
    local users to cause memory corruption by use of an ioctl with
    insufficient privilege restrictions.
Eugene Teo discovered two issues in the SCTP subsystem which allow
    local users to obtain access to sensitive memory when the
    SCTP-AUTH extension is enabled.

DSA-1646
A weakness has been discovered in squid, a caching proxy server.  The
flaw was introduced upstream in response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6239&quot;&gt;CVE-2007-6239&lt;/a&gt;, and
announced by Debian in &lt;a href=&quot;dsa-1482&quot;&gt;DSA-1482-1&lt;/a&gt;.  The flaw involves an
over-aggressive bounds check on an array resize, and could be
exploited by an authorized client to induce a denial of service
condition against squid.

				<description>PowerDNS Recursor before 3.1.5 uses insufficient randomness to calculate (1) TRXID values and (2) UDP source port numbers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to poison a DNS cache, related to (a) algorithmic deficiencies in rand and random functions in external libraries, (b) use of a 32-bit seed value, and (c) choice of the time of day as the sole seeding information.</description>

DSA-1544
Amit Klein discovered that pdns-recursor, a caching DNS resolver, uses a
weak random number generator to create DNS transaction IDs and UDP
source port numbers.  As a result, cache poisoning attacks were
simplified. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1637&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-1637&lt;/a&gt;

DSA-1592
Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may
lead to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:
Wei Wang from McAfee reported a potential heap overflow in the
    ASN.1 decode code that is used by the SNMP NAT and CIFS
    subsystem. Exploitation of this issue may lead to arbitrary code
    execution. This issue is not believed to be exploitable with the
    pre-built kernel images provided by Debian, but it might be an
    issue for custom images built from the Debian-provided source
    package.
Brandon Edwards of McAfee Avert labs discovered an issue in the
    DCCP subsystem. Due to missing feature length checks it is possible
    to cause an overflow that may result in remote arbitrary code
    execution.

DSA-1548
Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in xpdf, a set of tools for
display and conversion of Portable Document Format (PDF) files.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problem:
Xpdf's handling of embedded fonts lacks sufficient validation
    and type checking.  If a maliciously crafted PDF file is opened, 
    the vulnerability may allow the execution of arbitrary code with
    the privileges of the user running xpdf.

corruption, which can be triggered by a crafted Cinepak file.
Luigi Auriemma discovered that it is possible to execute arbitrary code
via a long subtitle in an SSA file.
It was discovered that vlc is prone to a search path vulnerability,
which allows local users to perform privilege escalations.
Alin Rad Pop discovered that it is possible to execute arbitrary code
when opening a WAV file containing a large fmt chunk.
PÄąnar Yanarda&amp;#287; discovered that it is possible to execute arbitrary code
when opening a crafted mmst link.

DSA-1635
Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in freetype,
a FreeType 2 font engine, which could allow the execution of arbitrary
code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:
An integer overflow allows context-dependent attackers to execute
    arbitrary code via a crafted set of values within the Private
    dictionary table in a Printer Font Binary (PFB) file.
The handling of an invalid &lt;q&gt;number of axes&lt;/q&gt; field in the PFB file could
    trigger the freeing of arbitrary memory locations, leading to 
    memory corruption.
Multiple off-by-one errors allowed the execution of arbitrary code
    via malformed tables in PFB files, or invalid SHC instructions in
    TTF files.

DSA-1556
It has been discovered that the Perl interpreter may encounter a buffer
overflow condition when compiling certain regular expressions containing
Unicode characters.  This also happens if the offending characters are
contained in a variable reference protected by the \Q...\E quoting
construct.  When encountering this condition, the Perl interpreter
typically crashes, but arbitrary code execution cannot be ruled out.

				<description>The cookie authentication method in WordPress 2.5 relies on a hash of a concatenated string containing USERNAME and EXPIRY_TIME, which allows remote attackers to forge cookies by registering a username that results in the same concatenated string, as demonstrated by registering usernames beginning with &quot;admin&quot; to obtain administrator privileges, aka a &quot;cryptographic splicing&quot; issue.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-6013.</description>

DSA-1581
Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in GNUTLS, an
implementation of the SSL/TLS protocol suite.
NOTE: The libgnutls13 package, which provides the GNUTLS library, does
not contain logic to automatically restart potentially affected
services.  You must restart affected services manually (mainly Exim,
using &lt;q&gt;/etc/init.d/exim4 restart&lt;/q&gt;) after applying the update, to make
the changes fully effective.  Alternatively, you can reboot the system.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following 
problems:
A pre-authentication heap overflow involving oversized session
    resumption data may lead to arbitrary code execution.
Repeated client hellos may result in a pre-authentication denial of
    service condition due to a null pointer dereference.
Decoding cipher padding with an invalid record length may cause GNUTLS
    to read memory beyond the end of the received record, leading to a
    pre-authentication denial of service condition.

DSA-1580
It was discovered that phpGedView, an application to provide online access
to genealogical data, allowed remote attackers to gain administrator
privileges due to a programming error.
&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; this problem was a fundamental design flaw in the interface (API) to
connect phpGedView with external programs like content management systems.
Resolving this problem was only possible by completely reworking the API,
which is not considered appropriate for a security update. Since these are
peripheral functions probably not used by the large majority of package
users, it was decided to remove these interfaces. If you require that
interface nonetheless, you are advised to use a version of phpGedView
backported from Debian Lenny, which has a completely redesigned API.

DSA-1608
Sergei Golubchik discovered that MySQL, a widely-deployed database
server, did not properly validate optional data or index directory
paths given in a CREATE TABLE statement, nor would it (under proper
conditions) prevent two databases from using the same paths for data
or index files.  This permits an authenticated user with authorization
to create tables in one database to read, write or delete data from
tables subsequently created in other databases, regardless of other
GRANT authorizations.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies this weakness as &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2079&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-2079&lt;/a&gt;.

				<description>The GENERATE_SEED macro in PHP 4.x before 4.4.8 and 5.x before 5.2.5, when running on 32-bit systems, performs a multiplication using values that can produce a zero seed in rare circumstances, which allows context-dependent attackers to predict subsequent values of the rand and mt_rand functions and possibly bypass protection mechanisms that rely on an unknown initial seed.</description>

DSA-1789
Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the PHP&amp;nbsp;5
hypertext preprocessor. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems.
The following four vulnerabilities have already been fixed in the stable
(lenny) version of php5 prior to the release of lenny. This update now
addresses them for etch (oldstable) as well:
The GENERATE_SEED macro has several problems that make predicting
    generated random numbers easier, facilitating attacks against measures
    that use rand() or mt_rand() as part of a protection.
A buffer overflow in the mbstring extension allows attackers to execute
    arbitrary code via a crafted string containing an HTML entity.
The page_uid and page_gid variables are not correctly set, allowing
    use of some functionality intended to be restricted to root.
Directory traversal vulnerability in the ZipArchive::extractTo function
    allows attackers to write arbitrary files via a ZIP file with a file
    whose name contains .. (dot dot) sequences.
This update also addresses the following three vulnerabilities for both
oldstable (etch) and stable (lenny):
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, when display_errors is enabled,
    allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.
When running on Apache, PHP allows local users to modify behavior of
    other sites hosted on the same web server by modifying the
    mbstring.func_overload setting within .htaccess, which causes this
    setting to be applied to other virtual hosts on the same server. 
The JSON_parser function allows a denial of service (segmentation fault)
    via a malformed string to the json_decode API function.
Furthermore, two updates originally scheduled for the next point update for
oldstable are included in the etch package:
Let PHP use the system timezone database instead of the embedded
    timezone database which is out of date.
From the source tarball, the unused 'dbase' module has been removed
    which contained licensing problems.

				<description>Stack-based buffer overflow in the searchwn function in Wordnet 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long command line option.  NOTE: this issue probably does not cross privilege boundaries except in cases in which Wordnet is used as a back end.</description>

DSA-1634
Rob Holland discovered several programming errors in WordNet, an
electronic lexical database of the English language. These flaws could
allow arbitrary code execution when used with untrusted input, for
example when WordNet is in use as a back end for a web application.

				<description>OpenSC before 0.11.5 uses weak permissions (ADMIN file control information of 00) for the 5015 directory on smart cards and USB crypto tokens running Siemens CardOS M4, which allows physically proximate attackers to change the PIN.</description>
				<debian>
					<date>2008-08-04</date>
					<moreinfo>
DSA-1627
Chaskiel M Grundman discovered that opensc, a library and utilities to
handle smart cards, would initialise smart cards with the Siemens CardOS M4
card operating system without proper access rights. This allowed everyone
to change the card's PIN.
With this bug anyone can change a user PIN without having the PIN or PUK
or the superusers PIN or PUK. However it can not be used to figure out the
PIN. If the PIN on your card is still the same you always had, there's a
reasonable chance that this vulnerability has not been exploited.
This vulnerability affects only smart cards and USB crypto tokens based on
Siemens CardOS M4, and within that group only those that were initialised
with OpenSC. Users of other smart cards and USB crypto tokens, or cards
that have been initialised with some software other than OpenSC, are not
affected.
After upgrading the package, running
&lt;code&gt;pkcs15-tool&amp;nbsp;-T&lt;/code&gt;
will show you whether the card is fine or vulnerable. If the card is
vulnerable, you need to update the security setting using:
&lt;code&gt;pkcs15-tool&amp;nbsp;-T&amp;nbsp;-U&lt;/code&gt;.

				<description>Stack-based buffer overflow in the split_redraw function in split.c in mtr before 0.73, when invoked with the -p (aka --split) option, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS PTR record.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is a vulnerability in the ns_name_ntop function in resolv/ns_name.c in glibc and the proper fix should be in glibc; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in mtr.</description>

				<description>Heap-based buffer overflow in the SPF_dns_resolv_lookup function in Spf_dns_resolv.c in libspf2 before 1.2.8 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long DNS TXT record with a modified length field.</description>
				<debian>
					<date>2008-10-23</date>
					<moreinfo>
DSA-1659
Dan Kaminsky discovered that libspf2, an implementation of the Sender
Policy Framework (SPF) used by mail servers for mail filtering, handles
malformed TXT records incorrectly, leading to a buffer overflow
condition (&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2469&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-2469&lt;/a&gt;).
Note that the SPF configuration template in Debian's Exim configuration
recommends to use libmail-spf-query-perl, which does not suffer from
this issue.

				<description>Vim 7.1.314, 6.4, and other versions allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via Vim scripts that do not properly sanitize inputs before invoking the execute or system functions, as demonstrated using (1) filetype.vim, (3) xpm.vim, (4) gzip_vim, and (5) netrw.  NOTE: the originally reported version was 7.1.314, but the researcher actually found this set of issues in 7.1.298.  NOTE: the zipplugin issue (originally vector 2 in this identifier) has been subsumed by CVE-2008-3075.</description>

DSA-1733
Several vulnerabilities have been found in vim, an enhanced vi editor.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:
Jan Minar discovered that vim did not properly sanitise inputs
    before invoking the execute or system functions inside vim
    scripts. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
Jan Minar discovered that the tar plugin of vim did not properly
    sanitise the filenames in the tar archive or the name of the
    archive file itself, making it prone to arbitrary code execution.
Jan Minar discovered that the zip plugin of vim did not properly
    sanitise the filenames in the zip archive or the name of the
    archive file itself, making it prone to arbitrary code execution.
Jan Minar discovered that the netrw plugin of vim did not properly
    sanitise the filenames or directory names it is given. This could
    lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
Ben Schmidt discovered that vim did not properly escape characters
    when performing keyword or tag lookups. This could lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code.

				<description>libclamav/petite.c in ClamAV before 0.93.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted Petite file that triggers an out-of-bounds read.</description>

DSA-1616
Damian Put discovered a vulnerability in the ClamAV anti-virus
toolkit's parsing of Petite-packed Win32 executables.  The weakness
leads to an invalid memory access, and could enable an attacker to
crash clamav by supplying a maliciously crafted Petite-compressed
binary for scanning.  In some configurations, such as when clamav
is used in combination with mail servers, this could cause a system
to &lt;q&gt;fail open&lt;/q&gt;, facilitating a follow-on viral attack.
A previous version of this advisory referenced packages that were
built incorrectly and omitted the intended correction.  This
issue was fixed in packages referenced by the -2 revision of the
advisory.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this
weakness as &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2713&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-2713&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3215&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-3215&lt;/a&gt;.

DSA-1596
Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the TYPO3 content
management framework.
Because of a not sufficiently secure default value of the TYPO3
configuration variable fileDenyPattern, authenticated backend users
could upload files that allowed to execute arbitrary code as the
webserver user.
User input processed by fe_adminlib.inc is not being properly filtered
to prevent Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which is exposed when
specific plugins are in use.

				<description>Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.16 and 3.x before 3.0.1, Thunderbird before 2.0.0.16, and SeaMonkey before 1.1.11 use an incorrect integer data type as a CSS object reference counter in the CSSValue array (aka nsCSSValue:Array) data structure, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large number of references to a common CSS object, leading to a counter overflow and a free of in-use memory, aka ZDI-CAN-349.</description>

DSA-1615
Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a
runtime environment for XUL applications. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:
It was discovered that missing boundary checks on a reference
    counter for CSS objects can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
Devon Hubbard, Jesse Ruderman and Martijn Wargers discovered
    crashes in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of
    arbitrary code.
Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman and Gary Kwong discovered crashes in
    the Javascript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.
&lt;q&gt;moz_bug_r_a4&lt;/q&gt; discovered several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
Collin Jackson and Adam Barth discovered that Javascript code
    could be executed in the context of signed JAR archives.
&lt;q&gt;moz_bug_r_a4&lt;/q&gt; discovered that XUL documents can escalate
    privileges by accessing the pre-compiled &lt;q&gt;fastload&lt;/q&gt; file.
&lt;q&gt;moz_bug_r_a4&lt;/q&gt; discovered that missing input sanitising in the
    mozIJSSubScriptLoader.loadSubScript() function could lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code. Iceweasel itself is not affected, but
    some addons are.
Claudio Santambrogio discovered that missing access validation in
    DOM parsing allows malicious web sites to force the browser to
    upload local files to the server, which could lead to information
    disclosure.
Daniel Glazman discovered that a programming error in the code for
    parsing .properties files could lead to memory content being
    exposed to addons, which could lead to information disclosure.
Masahiro Yamada discovered that file URLs in directory listings
    were insufficiently escaped.
John G. Myers, Frank Benkstein and Nils Toedtmann discovered that
    alternate names on self-signed certificates were handled
    insufficiently, which could lead to spoofing of secure connections.
Greg McManus discovered a crash in the block reflow
    code, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.
Billy Rios discovered that passing an URL containing a pipe symbol
    to Iceweasel can lead to Chrome privilege escalation.

				<description>Postfix before 2.3.15, 2.4 before 2.4.8, 2.5 before 2.5.4, and 2.6 before 2.6-20080814, when the operating system supports hard links to symlinks, allows local users to append e-mail messages to a file to which a root-owned symlink points, by creating a hard link to this symlink and then sending a message.  NOTE: this can be leveraged to gain privileges if there is a symlink to an init script.</description>

DSA-1629
Sebastian Krahmer discovered that Postfix, a mail transfer agent,
incorrectly checks the ownership of a mailbox. In some configurations,
this allows for appending data to arbitrary files as root.
Note that only specific configurations are vulnerable; the default
Debian installation is not affected. Only a configuration meeting
the following requirements is vulnerable:
For a detailed treating of the issue, please refer to the upstream
&lt;a href=&quot;http://article.gmane.org/gmane.mail.postfix.announce/110&quot;&gt;author's announcement&lt;/a&gt;.

				<description>The shellescape function in Vim 7.0 through 7.2, including 7.2a.10, allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via the &quot;!&quot; (exclamation point) shell metacharacter in (1) the filename of a tar archive and possibly (2) the filename of the first file in a tar archive, which is not properly handled by the VIM TAR plugin (tar.vim) v.10 through v.22, as demonstrated by the shellescape, tarplugin.v2, tarplugin, and tarplugin.updated test cases.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2712. NOTE: this issue has the same root cause as CVE-2008-3075.  NOTE: due to the complexity of the associated disclosures and the incomplete information related to them, there may be inaccuracies in this CVE description and in external mappings to this identifier.</description>

				<description>The shellescape function in Vim 7.0 through 7.2, including 7.2a.10, allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via the &quot;!&quot; (exclamation point) shell metacharacter in (1) the filename of a ZIP archive and possibly (2) the filename of the first file in a ZIP archive, which is not properly handled by zip.vim in the VIM ZIP plugin (zipPlugin.vim) v.11 through v.21, as demonstrated by the zipplugin and zipplugin.v2 test cases.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2712.  NOTE: this issue has the same root cause as CVE-2008-3074.  NOTE: due to the complexity of the associated disclosures and the incomplete information related to them, there may be inaccuracies in this CVE description and in external mappings to this identifier.</description>

DSA-1641
Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a
tool to administrate MySQL databases over the web. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:
Remote authenticated users could execute arbitrary code on the
    host running phpMyAdmin through manipulation of a script parameter.
Cross site scripting through the setup script was possible in
    rare circumstances.
Protection has been added against remote websites loading phpMyAdmin
    into a frameset.
Cross site request forgery allowed remote attackers to create a new
    database, but not perform any other action on it.

DSA-1636
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may
lead to a denial of service or leak sensitive data. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:
Tobias Klein reported a locally exploitable data leak in the
    snd_seq_oss_synth_make_info() function. This may allow local users
    to gain access to sensitive information.
Zoltan Sogor discovered a coding error in the VFS that allows local users
    to exploit a kernel memory leak resulting in a denial of service.
Eugene Teo reported an integer overflow in the DCCP subsystem that
    may allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service in the form
    of a kernel panic.
Eugene Teo reported a missing bounds check in the SCTP subsystem.
    By exploiting an integer overflow in the SCTP_AUTH_KEY handling code,
    remote attackers may be able to cause a denial of service in the form
    of a kernel panic.
Kel Modderman reported an issue in the tmpfs filesystem that allows
    local users to crash a system by triggering a kernel BUG() assertion.
Alexey Dobriyan discovered an off-by-one-error in the iov_iter_advance
    function which can be exploited by local users to crash a system,
    resulting in a denial of service.
Vlad Yasevich reported several NULL pointer reference conditions in
    the SCTP subsystem that can be triggered by entering sctp-auth codepaths
    when the AUTH feature is inactive. This may allow attackers to cause
    a denial of service condition via a system panic.
Johann Dahm and David Richter reported an issue in the nfsd subsystem
    that may allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a
    buffer overflow.

DSA-1628
Brian Dowling discovered that the PowerDNS authoritative name server
does not respond to DNS queries which contain certain characters,
increasing the risk of successful DNS spoofing (&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3337&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-3337&lt;/a&gt;).  This
update changes PowerDNS to respond with SERVFAIL responses instead.

				<description>The regular expression engine (regex.c) in Ruby 1.8.5 and earlier, 1.8.6 through 1.8.6-p286, 1.8.7 through 1.8.7-p71, and 1.9 through r18423 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and crash) via multiple long requests to a Ruby socket, related to memory allocation failure, and as demonstrated against Webrick.</description>

DSA-1695
The regular expression engine of Ruby, a scripting language, contains a
memory leak which can be triggered remotely under certain circumstances,
leading to a denial of service condition (&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3443&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-3443&lt;/a&gt;).
In addition, this security update addresses a regression in the REXML
XML parser of the ruby1.8 package; the regression was introduced in
DSA-1651-1.

DSA-1687
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:
Tavis Ormandy reported a local DoS and potential privilege
    escalation in the Virtual Dynamic Shared Objects (vDSO)
    implementation.
Eugene Teo reported a local DoS issue in the ext2 and ext3
    filesystems.  Local users who have been granted the privileges
    necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted
    filesystem that causes the kernel to output error messages in an
    infinite loop.
Milos Szeredi reported that the usage of splice() on files opened
    with O_APPEND allows users to write to the file at arbitrary
    offsets, enabling a bypass of possible assumed semantics of the
    O_APPEND flag.
Vlad Yasevich reported an issue in the SCTP subsystem that may
    allow remote users to cause a local DoS by triggering a kernel
    oops.
Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfsplus
    filesystem.  Local users who have been granted the privileges
    necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted
    filesystem that causes the kernel to overrun a buffer, resulting
    in a system oops or memory corruption.
Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfsplus
    filesystem.  Local users who have been granted the privileges
    necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted
    filesystem that results in a kernel oops due to an unchecked
    return value.
Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfs filesystem.
    Local users who have been granted the privileges necessary to
    mount a filesystem would be able to craft a filesystem with a
    corrupted catalog name length, resulting in a system oops or
    memory corruption.
Andrea Bittau reported a DoS issue in the unix socket subsystem
    that allows a local user to cause memory corruption, resulting in
    a kernel panic.
Hugo Dias reported a DoS condition in the ATM subsystem that can
    be triggered by a local user by calling the svc_listen function
    twice on the same socket and reading /proc/net/atm/*vc.
Al Viro reported race conditions in the inotify subsystem that may
    allow local users to acquire elevated privileges.
Dann Frazier reported a DoS condition that allows local users to
    cause the out of memory handler to kill off privileged processes
    or trigger soft lockups due to a starvation issue in the unix
    socket subsystem.

Vlad Yasevich reported an issue in the SCTP subsystem that may
    allow remote users to cause a local DoS by triggering a kernel
    oops.
Wei Yongjun reported an issue in the SCTP subsystem that may allow
    remote users to cause a local DoS by triggering a kernel panic.
Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfsplus
    filesystem.  Local users who have been granted the privileges
    necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted
    filesystem that causes the kernel to overrun a buffer, resulting
    in a system oops or memory corruption.
Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfsplus
    filesystem.  Local users who have been granted the privileges
    necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted
    filesystem that results in a kernel oops due to an unchecked
    return value.
Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfs filesystem.

DSA-1637
Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in git-core, the core of
the git distributed revision control system.  Improper path length
limitations in git's diff and grep functions, in combination with
maliciously crafted repositories or changes, could enable a stack
buffer overflow and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this
vulnerability as &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3546&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-3546&lt;/a&gt;.

DSA-1656
Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Common UNIX
Printing System. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:
It was discovered that insufficient bounds checking in the SGI
    image filter may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
It was discovered that an integer overflow in the Postscript
    conversion tool &lt;q&gt;texttops&lt;/q&gt; may lead to the execution of arbitrary
    code.
It was discovered that insufficient bounds checking in the HPGL
    filter may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

DSA-1651
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for
the Ruby language, which may lead to denial of service and other
security problems. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:
Keita Yamaguchi discovered that several safe level restrictions
    are insufficiently enforced.
Christian Neukirchen discovered that the WebRick module uses
    inefficient algorithms for HTTP header splitting, resulting in
    denial of service through resource exhaustion.
It was discovered that the dl module doesn't perform taintness
    checks.
Luka Treiber and Mitja Kolsek discovered that recursively nested
    XML entities can lead to denial of service through resource
    exhaustion in rexml.
Tanaka Akira discovered that the resolv module uses sequential
    transaction IDs and a fixed source port for DNS queries, which
    makes it more vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks.

DSA-1647
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, a server-side,
HTML-embedded scripting language. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:
Buffer overflow in the imageloadfont function allows a denial
    of service or code execution through a crafted font file.
Buffer overflow in the memnstr function allows a denial of
    service  or code execution via a crafted delimiter parameter
    to the explode function.
Denial of service is possible in the FastCGI module by a
    remote attacker by making a request with multiple dots
    before the extension.

				<description>Buffer overflow in the memnstr function in PHP 4.4.x before 4.4.9 and PHP 5.6 through 5.2.6 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via the delimiter argument to the explode function.  NOTE: the scope of this issue is limited since most applications would not use an attacker-controlled delimiter, but local attacks against safe_mode are feasible.</description>

				<description>The administration application in Django 0.91, 0.95, and 0.96 stores unauthenticated HTTP POST requests and processes them after successful authentication occurs, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and delete or modify data via unspecified requests.</description>
				<debian>
					<date>2008-09-20</date>
					<moreinfo>
DSA-1640
Simon Willison discovered that in Django, a Python web framework, the
feature to retain HTTP POST data during user reauthentication allowed
a remote attacker to perform unauthorized modification of data through
cross site request forgery. This is possible regardless of the Django
plugin to prevent cross site request forgery being enabled. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this issue as
&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3909&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-3909&lt;/a&gt;.
In this update the affected feature is disabled; this is in accordance
with upstream's preferred solution for this situation.
This update takes the opportunity to also include a relatively minor
denial of service attack in the internationalisation framework, known
as &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5712&quot;&gt;CVE-2007-5712&lt;/a&gt;.

					<date>2008-10-26</date>
					<moreinfo>
DSA-1660
Several denial-of-service vulnerabilities have been discovered in
the ClamAV anti-virus toolkit:
Insufficient checking for out-of-memory conditions results in null
pointer dereferences (&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3912&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-3912&lt;/a&gt;).
Incorrect error handling logic leads to memory leaks (&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3913&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-3913&lt;/a&gt;)
and file descriptor leaks (&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3914&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-3914&lt;/a&gt;).

DSA-1783
Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified affecting MySQL, a
relational database server, and its associated interactive client
application.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following two problems:
Kay Roepke reported that the MySQL server would not properly handle
    an empty bit-string literal in an SQL statement, allowing an
    authenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (a crash)
    in mysqld.  This issue affects the oldstable distribution (etch), but
    not the stable distribution (lenny).
Thomas Henlich reported that the MySQL commandline client application
    did not encode HTML special characters when run in HTML output mode
    (that is, &quot;mysql --html ...&quot;).  This could potentially lead to
    cross-site scripting or unintended script privilege escalation if
    the resulting output is viewed in a browser or incorporated into
    a web site.

DSA-1662
A symlink traversal vulnerability was discovered in MySQL, a
relational database server.  The weakness could permit an attacker
having both CREATE TABLE access to a database and the ability to
execute shell commands on the database server to bypass MySQL access
controls, enabling them to write to tables in databases to which they
would not ordinarily have access.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this
vulnerability as &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4098&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-4098&lt;/a&gt;.  Note that a closely aligned issue,
identified as &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4097&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-4097&lt;/a&gt;, was prevented by the update announced in
DSA-1608-1.  This new update supersedes that fix and mitigates both
potential attack vectors.

DSA-1666
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GNOME XML library.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the 
following problems:
Drew Yao discovered that missing input sanitising in the
    xmlBufferResize() function may lead to an infinite loop,
    resulting in denial of service.
Drew Yao discovered that an integer overflow in the
    xmlSAX2Characters() function may lead to denial of service or
    the execution of arbitrary code.

					<date>2008-10-06</date>

DSA-1645
Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd,
a fast webserver with minimal memory footprint. 
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following 
problems:
A memory leak in the http_request_parse function could be used by
    remote attackers to cause lighttpd to consume memory, and cause a
    denial of service attack.
Inconsistant handling of URL patterns could lead to the disclosure
    of resources a server administrator did not anticipate when using
    rewritten URLs.
Upon filesystems which don't handle case-insensitive paths differently
    it might be possible that unanticipated resources could be made available
    by mod_userdir.

DSA-1794
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to denial of service, privilege escalation, or information
leak. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:
Bryn M. Reeves reported a denial of service in the NFS filesystem.
    Local users can trigger a kernel BUG() due to a race condition in
    the do_setlk function.
Helge Deller discovered a denial of service condition that allows
    local users on PA-RISC to crash the system by attempting to unwind
    a stack containing userspace addresses.
Vlad Malov reported an issue on 64-bit MIPS where a local user
    could cause a system crash by crafting a malicious binary which
    makes o32 syscalls with a number less than 4000.
Zvonimir Rakamaric reported an off-by-one error in the ib700wdt
    watchdog driver which allows local users to cause a buffer
    underflow by making a specially crafted WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT ioctl
    call.
Flavio Leitner discovered that a local user can cause a denial of
    service by generating large amounts of traffic on a large SMP
    system, resulting in soft lockups.
Chris Evans discovered a situation in which a child process can
    send an arbitrary signal to its parent.
Christian Borntraeger discovered an issue effecting the alpha,
    mips, powerpc, s390 and sparc64 architectures that allows local
    users to cause a denial of service or potentially gain elevated
    privileges.
Vegard Nossum discovered a memory leak in the keyctl subsystem
    that allows local users to cause a denial of service by consuming
    all available kernel memory.
Wei Yongjun discovered a memory overflow in the SCTP
    implementation that can be triggered by remote users, permitting
    remote code execution.
Pavel Roskin provided a fix for an issue in the dell_rbu driver
    that allows a local user to cause a denial of service (oops) by
    reading 0 bytes from a sysfs entry.
Roel Kluin discovered inverted logic in the skfddi driver that
    permits local, unprivileged users to reset the driver statistics.
Clement LECIGNE discovered a bug in the sock_getsockopt function
    that may result in leaking sensitive kernel memory.
Roland McGrath discovered an issue on amd64 kernels that allows
    local users to circumvent system call audit configurations which
    filter based on the syscall numbers or argument details.
Jiri Olsa discovered that a local user can cause a denial of
    service (system hang) using a SHM_INFO shmctl call on kernels
    compiled with CONFIG_SHMEM disabled. This issue does not affect
    prebuilt Debian kernels.
Shaohua Li reported an issue in the AGP subsystem that may allow
    local users to read sensitive kernel memory due to a leak of
    uninitialized memory.
Thomas Pollet reported an overflow in the af_rose implementation
    that allows remote attackers to retrieve uninitialized kernel
    memory that may contain sensitive data.
Trond Myklebust reported an issue in the encode_lookup() function
    in the nfs server subsystem that allows local users to cause a
    denial of service (oops in encode_lookup()) by use of a long
    filename.
Oleg Nesterov discovered an issue in the exit_notify function that
    allows local users to send an arbitrary signal to a process by
    running a program that modifies the exit_signal field and then
    uses an exec system call to launch a setuid application.
Pavan Naregundi reported an issue in the CIFS filesystem code that
    allows remote users to overwrite memory via a long
    nativeFileSystem field in a Tree Connect response during mount.

problems:
Bryn M. Reeves reported a denial of service in the NFS filesystem.
    Local users can trigger a kernel BUG() due to a race condition in
    the do_setlk function.
Hugo Dias reported a DoS condition in the ATM subsystem that can
    be triggered by a local user by calling the svc_listen function
    twice on the same socket and reading /proc/net/atm/*vc.
Helge Deller discovered a denial of service condition that allows
    local users on PA-RISC systems to crash a system by attempting to
    unwind a stack containing userspace addresses.
Alan Cox discovered a lack of minimum timeouts on SG_IO requests,
    which allows local users of systems using ATA to cause a denial of
    service by forcing drives into PIO mode.
Vlad Malov reported an issue on 64-bit MIPS systems where a local
    user could cause a system crash by crafing a malicious binary
    which makes o32 syscalls with a number less than 4000.
Zvonimir Rakamaric reported an off-by-one error in the ib700wdt

Wei Yongjun discovered a memory overflow in the SCTP
    implementation that can be triggered by remote users, permitting
    remote code execution.
Duane Griffin provided a fix for an issue in the eCryptfs
    subsystem which allows local users to cause a denial of service
    (fault or memory corruption).
Pavel Roskin provided a fix for an issue in the dell_rbu driver
    that allows a local user to cause a denial of service (oops) by
    reading 0 bytes from a sysfs entry.
Roel Kluin discovered inverted logic in the skfddi driver that

Clement LECIGNE discovered a bug in the sock_getsockopt function
    that may result in leaking sensitive kernel memory.
Peter Kerwien discovered an issue in the ext4 filesystem that
    allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel oops)
    during a resize operation.
Roland McGrath discovered an issue on amd64 kernels that allows
    local users to circumvent system call audit configurations which
    filter based on the syscall numbers or argument details.
Jiri Olsa discovered that a local user can cause a denial of
    service (system hang) using a SHM_INFO shmctl call on kernels
    compiled with CONFIG_SHMEM disabled. This issue does not affect
    prebuilt Debian kernels.
Mikulas Patocka reported an issue in the console subsystem that
    allows a local user to cause memory corruption by selecting a
    small number of 3-byte UTF-8 characters.
Shaohua Li reported an issue in the AGP subsystem that may allow
    local users to read sensitive kernel memory due to a leak of
    uninitialized memory.
Benjamin Gilbert reported a local denial of service vulnerability
    in the KVM VMX implementation that allows local users to trigger
    an oops.

    that allows remote attackers to retrieve uninitialized kernel
    memory that may contain sensitive data.
Oleg Nesterov discovered an issue in the exit_notify function that
    allows local users to send an arbitrary signal to a process by
    running a program that modifies the exit_signal field and then
    uses an exec system call to launch a setuid application.
Daniel Hokka Zakrisson discovered that a kill(-1) is permitted to
    reach processes outside of the current process namespace.
Pavan Naregundi reported an issue in the CIFS filesystem code that
    allows remote users to overwrite memory via a long
    nativeFileSystem field in a Tree Connect response during mount.

				<description>The PMA_escapeJsString function in libraries/js_escape.lib.php in phpMyAdmin before 2.11.9.2, when Internet Explorer is used, allows remote attackers to bypass cross-site scripting (XSS) protection mechanisms and conduct XSS attacks via a NUL byte inside a &quot;&lt;/script&quot; sequence.</description>

DSA-1675
Masako Oono discovered that phpMyAdmin, a web-based administration
interface for MySQL, insufficiently sanitises input allowing a
remote attacker to gather sensitive data through cross site scripting,
provided that the user uses the Internet Explorer web browser.
This update also fixes a regression introduced in DSA 1641, that
broke changing of the language and encoding in the login screen.

DSA-1919
Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Smarty, a PHP
templating engine. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:
The _expand_quoted_text function allows for certain restrictions in
  templates, like function calling and PHP execution, to be bypassed.
The smarty_function_math function allows context-dependent attackers
  to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the equation
  attribute of the math function.

				<description>The _gnutls_x509_verify_certificate function in lib/x509/verify.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS before 2.6.1 trusts certificate chains in which the last certificate is an arbitrary trusted, self-signed certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert a spoofed certificate for any Distinguished Name (DN).</description>
				<debian>
					<date>2009-02-10</date>
					<moreinfo>
DSA-1719
Martin von Gagern discovered that GNUTLS, an implementation of the
TLS/SSL protocol, handles verification of X.509 certificate chains
incorrectly if a self-signed certificate is configured as a trusted
certificate.  This could cause clients to accept forged server
certificates as genuine.  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4989&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-4989&lt;/a&gt;)
In addition, this update tightens the checks for X.509v1 certificates
which causes GNUTLS to reject certain certificate chains it accepted
before.  (In certificate chain processing, GNUTLS does not recognize
X.509v1 certificates as valid unless explicitly requested by the
application.)

				<description>Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in (1) University of Washington IMAP Toolkit 2002 through 2007c, (2) University of Washington Alpine 2.00 and earlier, and (3) Panda IMAP allow (a) local users to gain privileges by specifying a long folder extension argument on the command line to the tmail or dmail program; and (b) remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending e-mail to a destination mailbox name composed of a username and '+' character followed by a long string, processed by the tmail or possibly dmail program.</description>

DSA-1685
Two vulnerabilities have been found in uw-imap, an IMAP
implementation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:
It was discovered that several buffer overflows can be triggered via a
long folder extension argument to the tmail or dmail program. This
could lead to arbitrary code execution (&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5005&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-5005&lt;/a&gt;).
It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference could be triggered by
a malicious response to the QUIT command leading to a denial of service
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5006&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-5006&lt;/a&gt;).

DSA-1680
Moritz Jodeit discovered that ClamAV, an anti-virus solution, suffers
from an off-by-one-error in its VBA project file processing, leading to
a heap-based buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5050&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-5050&lt;/a&gt;).
Ilja van Sprundel discovered that ClamAV contains a denial of service
condition in its JPEG file processing because it does not limit the
recursion depth when processing JPEG thumbnails (&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5314&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-5314&lt;/a&gt;).

				<description>WordPress 2.6.3 relies on the REQUEST superglobal array in certain dangerous situations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct delayed and persistent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks via crafted cookies, as demonstrated by attacks that (1) delete user accounts or (2) cause a denial of service (loss of application access).  NOTE: this issue relies on the presence of an independent vulnerability that allows cookie injection.</description>

				<description>** DISPUTED **  The set_language_path function in geshi.php in Generic Syntax Highlighter (GeSHi) before 1.0.8.1 might allow remote attackers to conduct file inclusion attacks via crafted inputs that influence the default language path ($path variable).  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a vendor, stating that only a static value is used, so this is not a vulnerability in GeSHi. Separate CVE identifiers would be created for web applications that integrate GeSHi in a way that allows control of the default language path.</description>

DSA-1678
Paul Szabo rediscovered a vulnerability in the File::Path::rmtree
function of Perl. It was possible to exploit a race condition to create
setuid binaries in a directory tree or remove arbitrary files when a
process is deleting this tree.  This issue was originally known as
&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-0448&quot;&gt;CVE-2005-0448&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-0452&quot;&gt;CVE-2004-0452&lt;/a&gt;, which were addressed by DSA-696-1 and
DSA-620-1. Unfortunately, they were reintroduced later.

					<moreinfo>
DSA-1684
Two vulnerabilities have been found in lcms, a library and set of
commandline utilities for image color management.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:
Inadequate enforcement of fixed-length buffer limits allows an
    attacker to overflow a buffer on the stack, potentially enabling
    the execution of arbitrary code when a maliciously-crafted
    image is opened.
An integer sign error in reading image gamma data could allow an
    attacker to cause an under-sized buffer to be allocated for
    subsequent image data, with unknown consequences potentially
    including the execution of arbitrary code if a maliciously-crafted
    image is opened.

				<description>/bin/login in shadow 4.0.18.1 in Debian GNU/Linux, and probably other Linux distributions, allows local users in the utmp group to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a temporary file referenced in a line (aka ut_line) field in a utmp entry.</description>
				<debian>
					<date>2009-01-21</date>
					<moreinfo>
DSA-1709
Paul Szabo discovered that login, the system login tool, did not
correctly handle symlinks while setting up tty permissions. If a local
attacker were able to gain control of the system utmp file, they could
cause login to change the ownership and permissions on arbitrary files,
leading to a root privilege escalation.

DSA-1708
It was discovered that gitweb, the web interface for the Git version
control system, contained several vulnerabilities:
Remote attackers could use crafted requests to execute shell commands on
the web server, using the snapshot generation and pickaxe search
functionality (&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5916&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-5916&lt;/a&gt;).
Local users with write access to the configuration of a Git repository
served by gitweb could cause gitweb to execute arbitrary shell commands
with the permission of the web server (&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5516&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-5516&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5517&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-5517&lt;/a&gt;).

				<description>The JK Connector (aka mod_jk) 1.2.0 through 1.2.26 in Apache Tomcat allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via an arbitrary request from an HTTP client, in opportunistic circumstances involving (1) a request from a different client that included a Content-Length header but no POST data or (2) a rapid series of requests, related to noncompliance with the AJP protocol's requirements for requests containing Content-Length headers.</description>

DSA-1810
An information disclosure flaw was found in mod_jk, the Tomcat Connector
module for Apache. If a buggy client included the &quot;Content-Length&quot; header
without providing request body data, or if a client sent repeated 
requests very quickly, one client could obtain a response intended for
another client.
The oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.2.18-3etch2.

DSA-1907
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in kvm, a full virtualization system.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:
Chris Webb discovered an off-by-one bug limiting KVM's VNC passwords to 7
characters. This flaw might make it easier for remote attackers to guess the VNC
password, which is limited to seven characters where eight was intended.
It was discovered that the kvm_emulate_hypercall function in KVM does not
prevent access to MMU hypercalls from ring 0, which allows local guest OS users
to cause a denial of service (guest kernel crash) and read or write guest kernel
memory.
The oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain kvm.

It was discovered that netatalk, an implementation of the AppleTalk
suite, is affected by a command injection vulnerability when processing
PostScript streams via papd.  This could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.  Please note that this only affects installations that are
configured to use a pipe command in combination with wildcard symbols
substituted with values of the printed job.

				<description>Heap-based buffer overflow in msadpcm.c in libaudiofile in audiofile 0.2.6 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted WAV file.</description>
				<debian>
					<date>2010-01-17</date>
					<moreinfo>
DSA-1972
Max Kellermann discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the handling
of ADPCM WAV files in libaudiofile. This flaw could result in a denial
of service (application crash) or possibly execution of arbitrary code
via a crafted WAV file.
The old stable distribution (etch), this problem will be fixed in
version 0.2.6-6+etch1.
The packages for the oldstable distribution are not included in this
advisory. An update will be released soon.

It was discovered that imlib2, a library to load and process several image
formats, did not properly process various image file types.
Several heap and stack based buffer overflows - partly due to integer
overflows - in the ARGB, BMP, JPEG, LBM, PNM, TGA and XPM loaders can
lead to the execution of arbitrary code via crafted image files.

DSA-1871
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in wordpress, weblog
manager. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:
It was discovered that wordpress is prone to an open redirect 
vulnerability which allows remote attackers to conduct phishing atacks.
It was discovered that remote attackers had the ability to trigger an
application upgrade, which could lead to a denial of service attack.
It was discovered that wordpress lacks authentication checks in the
plugin configuration, which might leak sensitive information.
It was discovered that wordpress lacks authentication checks in various
actions, thus allowing remote attackers to produce unauthorised edits or
additions.
It was discovered that the administrator interface is prone to a
cross-site scripting attack.
It was discovered that remote attackers can gain privileges via certain
direct requests.
It was discovered that the _bad_protocol_once function in KSES, as used
by wordpress, allows remote attackers to perform cross-site scripting
attacks.
It was discovered that wordpress lacks certain checks around user
information, which could be used by attackers to change the password of
a user.
It was discovered that the get_category_template function is prone to a
directory traversal vulnerability, which could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.
It was discovered that the _httpsrequest function in the embedded snoopy
version is prone to the execution of arbitrary commands via shell
metacharacters in https URLs.
It was discovered that wordpress relies on the REQUEST superglobal array
in certain dangerous situations, which makes it easier to perform
attacks via crafted cookies.

DSA-1879
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the software suite for the
SILC protocol, a network protocol designed to provide end-to-end security
for conferencing services.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:
An incorrect format string in sscanf() used in the ASN1 encoder to scan an
OID value could overwrite a neighbouring variable on the stack as the
destination data type is smaller than the source type on 64-bit. On 64-bit
architectures this could result in unexpected application behaviour or even
code execution in some cases.
Various format string vulnerabilities when handling parsed SILC messages
allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the rights of the victim
running the SILC client via crafted nick names or channel names containing
format strings.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-7160&quot;&gt;CVE-2008-7160&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An incorrect format string in a sscanf() call used in the HTTP server
component of silcd could result in overwriting a neighbouring variable on
the stack as the destination data type is smaller than the source type on
64-bit.  An attacker could exploit this by using crafted Content-Length
header values resulting in unexpected application behaviour or even code
execution in some cases.
silc-server doesn't need an update as it uses the shared library provided
by silc-toolkit. silc-client/silc-toolkit in the oldstable distribution
(etch) is not affected by this problem.

DSA-2034
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a tool
to administer MySQL over the web. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:
phpMyAdmin may create a temporary directory, if the configured directory
    does not exist yet, with insecure filesystem permissions.
phpMyAdmin uses predictable filenames for temporary files, which may
    lead to a local denial of service attack or privilege escalation.
The setup.php script shipped with phpMyAdmin may unserialize untrusted
    data, allowing for cross site request forgery.
