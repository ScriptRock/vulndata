        <description>A vulnerability in the SNMP implementation of could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to the affected device.  The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the affected code area. The vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP (versions 1, 2c, and 3). The attacker must know the SNMP read only community string (SNMP version 2c or earlier) or the user credentials (SNMPv3). An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system or to cause a reload of the affected system.  Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.</description>

        <description>Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted device.  The vulnerability is due to errors in processing malformed packets. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious network packets to a device. If successful, the attacker could cause components of the device to stop responding, resulting in a DoS condition.  Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security advisory and has released updated software.  Only devices that use Gambino DSP components are vulnerable. Devices with different DSP components, or those without the component, are unaffected.  To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send malicious network requests to affected devices. Attackers may require access to internal networks to send RTP requests to a device, limiting the potential for exploitation.  Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</description>

        <reference ref_id="CVE-2014-7997" source="CVE" />
        <description>A vulnerability in the DHCP subsystem of Cisco Aironet access points could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to create a denial of service condition.  The vulnerability is due to an error condition that may occur when very short DHCP leases are in use. If an attacker can prevent the access point from renewing its lease, the device may restart after unsuccessful DHCP Renew attempts in an effort to reestablish network connectivity. The expected behavior is that the network interface would restart but not the device.  This vulnerability was reported to Cisco by Maxim Salomon and Timo Warns of Airbus Operations GmbH.</description>

        <reference ref_id="CVE-2006-4776" source="CVE" />
        <description>Cisco IOS contains a vulnerability that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.  The vulnerability exists due to improper input validation by the VTP feature of Cisco IOS. An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious VTP summary advertisement to an affected system. This action could result in a buffer overflow, resetting the affected system or allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.  Cisco confirmed this vulnerability in a security response and released updated software.  To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to craft a VTP summary advertisement packet that specifies a domain that matches the domain of the target system. This knowledge may be difficult for an external attacker to determine. Additionally, the attacker must send the packet in such a way that it arrives at the target system on a trunk enabled port. To do this, the attacker must determine an appropriate destination address for a vulnerable target. Depending on local network configuration, reaching the target system on a trunk enabled port may limit the systems from which the attacker can stage an attack.  Because standard suggested practice is to set a VTP domain password, the attacker must also know or guess this password to exploit this  vulnerability.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) implementation in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.  The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of specific SIP messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SIP message on an established call or initiating a call that includes the crafted SIP message, which would trigger a device reload. Only traffic destined to the device can trigger the vulnerability; transit SIP traffic is not an exploit vector. This vulnerability can be exploited with SIP over IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6) communications protocol. This vulnerability can be exploited with SIP over UDP traffic or SIP over TCP traffic.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the SSH version 2 (SSHv2) implementation of the public key authentication method of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass user authentication.  The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the implementation of the SSHv2 public key authentication method, also known as Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA)-based user authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected system configured for SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication using a crafted private key. The attacker must know a valid username configured for RSA-based user authentication and the public key configured for that user to exploit this vulnerability.  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass user authentication and log in with the privileges of the user or with the privileges configured for the virtual teletype (VTY) line. Depending on the configuration of the user and of the VTY line, the attacker may obtain administrative privileges on the system. The attacker cannot use this vulnerability to elevate privileges.</description>

        <description>Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software contain a vulnerability in the RSVP feature when used on a device configured with VPN routing and forwarding (VRF) instances. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an interface wedge, which can lead to loss of connectivity, loss of routing protocol adjacency, and other denial of service (DoS) conditions. This vulnerability could be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended DoS condition.  A device is vulnerable if it is configured with VRF and none of the interfaces in that VRF have RSVP enabled, but any other interface (physical or virtual) does have RSVP enabled.  An attacker with some knowledge of the affected infrastructure could exploit this vulnerability by sending RSVP packets to vulnerable devices. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to wedge the receive queue of any RSVP ingress interface.  A workaround is available to mitigate this vulnerability.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(04)M or Cisco IOS Software Release 15.4(03)M and are configured to use access control lists (ACLs) could allow a user who is connected to an authenticated PPP session to bypass ACLs that are configured on virtual PPP interfaces, if the ACL on the physical interface permits the traffic to pass.  The vulnerability is due to the physical interface ignoring virtual PPP ACLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass virtual PPP ACLs and pass denied traffic across virtual PPP interfaces. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to pass traffic as if the ACLs do not exist.</description>

        <reference ref_id="CVE-2015-4185" source="CVE" />
        <description>A vulnerability in the Tool Command Language (TCL) script interpreter of Cisco IOS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate privileges from those of a non-privileged user to a privileged (level 15) user. This would allow a non-privileged user to execute privileged commands (those under privilege level 15).  The vulnerability is due to an error when resetting vty privileges after running a TCL script. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a session with an affected device immediately after a TCL script has been run. An attacker would need to provide valid credentials and successfully pass authentication to the device.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the H.323 subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.  The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly validate certain fields in an H.323 protocol suite message. When processing the malicious message, the affected device may attempt to access an invalid memory region, resulting in a crash. An attacker who can submit an H.323 packet designed to trigger the vulnerability could cause the affected device to crash and restart.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the event manager environment and publish-event function of the Cisco Cloud Services Router 1000V Series could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a command injection attack with root-level privileges.  The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of event manager environment variables that are configured on the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device with administrative privileges, modifying the configuration of the device, and then invoking a crafted event manager script. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to compromise the affected system using commands that are executed with root-level privileges.</description>

        <reference ref_id="CVE-2006-4774" source="CVE" />
        <description>Cisco IOS contains a vulnerability in the VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability exists because the VTP feature in several versions of Cisco IOS software does not properly handle malformed packets sent from the local network. An attacker residing on the local network segment could exploit this vulnerability via a crafted summary packet to cause a DoS condition.  Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security advisory and released updated software to correct it.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must reside on the local network segment and send a crafted summary packet to a device supporting VTP. The device must be configured as either client or server for VTP. Additionally, the packets must be received on a trunk enabled port. Switches configured with a VTP domain password are still affected.  The switch receiving the packet generates syslog messages for either watchdog timeout or CPU hog for process VLAN Manager prior to the software reset. Exploitation causes a DoS condition only until the device reboots. Repeated attacks could cause an extended DoS condition.</description>

        <description>Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) implementation in Cisco IOS® Software that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device when SIP operation is enabled.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds for devices that must run SIP; however, mitigations are available to limit exposure to the vulnerabilities.  This advisory is posted at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-sip["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-sip"].  Note: The September 22, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. Five of the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one advisory addresses vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Each advisory lists the releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table at the following URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities that have been published on September 22, 2010, or earlier:  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-bundle["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-bundle"]  Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep10.html["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep10.html"]  Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) is affected by the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Two separate Cisco Security Advisories have been published to disclose the vulnerabilities that affect the Cisco Unified Communications Manager at the following locations:  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20090826-cucm["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20090826-cucm"]  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-cucmsip["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-cucmsip"]</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange (IKEv1) state machine of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to tear down valid IPsec connections, resulting in a partial denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient condition checks in the IKEv1 state machine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a spoofed, specific IKEv1 packet to an endpoint of an IPsec tunnel. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to tear down IPsec tunnels that terminate on the endpoint, causing a partial DoS condition.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the standard and the special Network Time Protocol query program (ntpq and ntpdc) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain the value of the origin timestamp expected in the next peer response.  The vulnerability is due to ntpq and ntpdc providing this information without requiring authentication. An attacker could exploit this issue by querying the client with the appropriate ntpq or ntpdc commands. An exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the next peer response origin timestamp, which could be leveraged in further attacks.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the UDP processing code of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the input queue of an affected system to hold UDP packets, causing an interface queue wedge and a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to Cisco IOS Software application changes that create UDP sockets and leave the sockets idle without closing them. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending UDP packets with a destination port of 0 to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause UDP packets to be held in the input interfaces queue, resulting in a DoS condition. The input interface queue will stop holding UDP packets when it receives 250 packets.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the IPv6 to IPv4 subsystem of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a standby Performance Routing Engine (PRE) to leak a small portion of memory on a targeted system, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to a failure to free a portion of memory allocated to store the IPv6 address of a connecting customer premises equipment (CPE) device when a specific error condition is encountered. An attacker who can trigger a specific type of failed CPE negotiation could cause the standby PRE to leak a small portion of memory, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

        <description>An issue in the multiblock feature of OpenSSL could result in the failure of client connections.  The issue is due to an implementation error in the OpenSSL multiblock performance feature. On 64-bit platforms, the implementation error could set a memory pointer to NULL, causing an error condition that could prevent client connections. An attacker has no way to exploit this issue because there is no vector to manipulate the memory in use by the multiblock feature.</description>

        <description>Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol which provides a secure remote access connection to network devices.  The SSH server implementation in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software contains a DoS vulnerability in the SSH version 2 (SSHv2) feature that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a device to reload. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting a reverse SSH login with a crafted username. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to create a DoS condition by causing the device to reload. Repeated exploits could create a sustained DoS condition.  The SSH server in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software is an optional service, but its use is highly recommended as a security best practice for management of Cisco IOS devices. SSH can be configured as part of the AutoSecure feature in the initial configuration of IOS devices, AutoSecure run after initial configuration, or manually. SSH is enabled any time RSA keys are generated such as when an http secure-server or trust points for digital certificates are configured. Devices that are not configured to accept SSHv2 connections are not affected by this vulnerability.</description>

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to the affected device.  The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the affected code area. The vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP (versions 1, 2c, and 3). The attacker must know the SNMP read only community string (SNMP version 2c or earlier) or the user credentials (SNMPv3). An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system or to cause a reload of the affected system.  Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.</description>

        <description>Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted system.  The vulnerability is due to an unspecified issue that causes a device running the vulnerable software to reload when the web browser reloads the SSL VPN portal page. An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a web browser to refresh the SSL VPN portal page to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. A successful exploit could deny services for legitimate users.  Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability and has released updated software.  A successful exploit would require an attacker to authenticate to a targeted device. This access requirement would likely limit the chances of a successful exploit.  Reports have indicated that the vulnerability was seen on the stock Android browser; however, the issue is not browser-specific and other browsers may trigger this vulnerability.  Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</description>

        <description>Multiple Cisco products contain either of two authentication vulnerabilities in the Simple Network Management Protocol version 3 (SNMPv3) feature. These vulnerabilities can be exploited when processing a malformed SNMPv3 message. These vulnerabilities could allow the disclosure of network information or may enable an attacker to perform configuration changes to vulnerable devices. The SNMP server is an optional service that is disabled by default in Cisco products. Only SNMPv3 is impacted by these vulnerabilities. Workarounds are available for mitigating the impact of the vulnerabilities described in this document.  Note: SNMP versions 1, 2 and 2c are not impacted by these vulnerabilities.  The United States Computer Emergency Response Team (US-CERT) has assigned Vulnerability Note VU#878044["http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/878044"]  to these vulnerabilities.  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2008-0960["http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-0960"]  has also been assigned to these vulnerabilities.

        <description>A vulnerability in the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to replay broadcast server packets.  The vulnerability is due to no replay protection on NTP broadcast packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by capturing and retransmiting NTP broadcast packets to a targeted system. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause time settings on a targeted system to stop updating and maintain a particular time value.</description>

        <description>The NAT SIP application layer gateway (ALG) ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2t/12_2t8/feature/guide/ftnatsip.html"] feature adds the ability to deploy Cisco IOS NAT between VoIP solutions based on SIP by translating IP addresses that are embedded in the SIP payload of IP packets.  Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability in the NAT processing of SIP packets. This vulnerability is present when the NAT SIP ALG feature is enabled.  NAT SIP ALG is enabled by default, and performs the SIP payload translation of IP packets. NAT SIP translation is done on UDP port 5060 packets by default. The port is configurable using the ip nat service sip udp port global configuration command.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the Cisco Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) processing code in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device or remotely execute code with elevated privileges.  The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors:  The failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device, and  The incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the implementation of Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) server functionality in Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access data from a packet buffer that was previously used.  The vulnerability is due to the use of a previously used packet buffer whose content was not cleared from memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a PPTP connection request to device that is running a vulnerable release of the affected software and is configured for PPTP server functionality. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access up to 63 bytes of memory that were previously used for a packet and were either destined to the device or generated by the device. An exploit would not allow the attacker to access packet data from transit traffic. In addition, an exploit would not allow the attacker to access arbitrary memory locations that the attacker chooses.</description>

        <reference ref_id="CVE-2007-5134" source="CVE" />
        <description>Cisco IOS running on Catalyst 6500 and Cisco 7600 contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured ACLs.  The vulnerability exists because the affected devices accept traffic to IP addresses that are reserved for use by the Ethernet Out-of-Band Channel (EOBC). These addresses are not typically protected by ACLs, as they are not expected to be reachable outside the EOBC. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass ACLs configured to protect exposed management addresses and send packets to intelligent modules such as the Supervisor or Multi-layer Switch Feature Card (MSFC).  Exploit code is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security response and released updated software.  The vulnerability affects Catalyst 6500 and Cisco 7000 devices that are running in both Hybrid Mode (CatOS on the Supervisor Engine and IOS on the MSFC) and Native Mode (IOS on both the Supervisor Engine and the MSFC). The 127.0.0.0/8 network is reserved for loopback and internal communications, as specified in RFC 3330["http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3330.html"]. As such, traffic bound for this network is not routed over the public Internet. However, some default configurations of IOS running on Cisco Routers may allow such traffic to pass over trusted internal networks. The circumstances that would allow this are very specific and are unlikely to occur in most networks. These factors dramatically lower the pool of potential  attackers. Any attacker that bypasses ACLs using this vulnerability to access an affected device must still authenticate to perform actions such as modifying configuration files.  Multiple methods exist to effectively mitigate this vulnerability without downtime or software upgrades. Administrators of high availability environments are advised to utilize ACLs or Control Plane Policing (CoPP) to prevent unwanted traffic from reaching intelligent management cards. Administrators are still encouraged to update the software running on these devices during the next scheduled and planned outage.  This vulnerability has been resolved with the release of 12.2(33)SXH.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the standard and special Network Time Protocol query program (ntpq and ntpdc) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the ntpq or ntpdc program to remain in a processing loop.  The vulnerability is due to a loop that is not exited under certain conditions in the ntpq and ntpdc processes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an ntpq or ntpdc client from a malicious NTP server or from a privileged network position by conducting a man-in-the-middle attack between a targeted client and the NTP server. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ntpq or ntpdc process to enter an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.</description>

        <description>Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability involving the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Routing Protocol Link State Advertisement (LSA) database. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to take full control of the OSPF Autonomous System (AS) domain routing table, blackhole traffic, and intercept traffic.  The attacker could trigger this vulnerability by injecting crafted OSPF packets. Successful exploitation could cause flushing of the routing table on a targeted router, as well as propagation of the crafted OSPF LSA type 1 update throughout the OSPF AS domain.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must accurately determine certain parameters within the LSA database on the target router. This vulnerability can only be triggered by sending crafted unicast or multicast LSA type 1 packets. No other LSA type packets can trigger this vulnerability.  OSPFv3 is not affected by this vulnerability. Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF) protocol is not affected by this vulnerability.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the IP Version 6 (IPv6) packet processing functions of multiple Cisco products could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to stop processing IPv6 traffic, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition on the device.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient processing logic for crafted IPv6 packets that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) packets to an affected device for processing. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to stop processing IPv6 traffic, leading to a DoS condition on the device.  This vulnerability is not Cisco specific: any IPv6 processing unit not capable of dropping such packets early in the processing path or in hardware is affected by this vulnerability.</description>

        <description>Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to improper handling of login banners by Cisco IOS Software. An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in via SSH using two sessions. If successful, the attacker could cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.  Cisco confirmed the vulnerability in software release notes and released updated software.  To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must be able to log in via SSH to a targeted device. The access requirement restricts the source of exploits to current users of an affected system. Exploits may happen accidentally when a legitimate user attempts to log in using two SSH sessions.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to leverage any trusted key, not just the trusted key for its address.  The vulnerability is exists because ntpd does not properly verify that the key being used matches the proper servers' key. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending packets with any trusted key, as long as the keyid references another key the systems share and that key is used to compute the message authentication code (MAC). An exploit could allow the attacker to masquerade as another configured trusted association.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability of the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the ntpd to crash by exhausting the call stack.  The vulnerability exists because function calls to list_restrict4() or list_restrict6() can be made to exhaust space on the call stack. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing an ntpdc reslist command against a device that has a large number of NTP restrictions in place. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ntpd to crash.</description>

        <description>Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability involving the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Routing Protocol Link State Advertisement (LSA) database. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to take full control of the OSPF Autonomous System (AS) domain routing table, allowing the attacker to intercept or black-hole traffic.  The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting crafted OSPF packets. Successful exploitation could cause the targeted router to flush its routing table and propagate the crafted OSPF LSA type 1 update throughout the OSPF AS domain.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must accurately determine certain parameters within the LSA database on the target router. This vulnerability can only be triggered by sending crafted unicast or multicast OSPF LSA type 1 packets. No other LSA type packets can trigger this vulnerability.  The Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF) protocol is not affected by this vulnerability.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the Zone-Based Firewall feature of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to pass traffic that should otherwise have been dropped based on the configuration.  The vulnerability is due to a logic flaw in a corner case scenario. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic that would have been dropped by the policy.  In a Zone-Based Firewall setup, if only one zone pair is defined in the egress direction but there is no reverse zone pair defined in the opposite direction, return traffic should be dropped instead of allowed for traffic subject to the egress action of pass.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the SNMP implementation of could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to the affected device.  The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the affected code area. The vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP (versions 1, 2c, and 3). The attacker must know the SNMP read only community string (SNMP version 2c or earlier) or the user credentials (SNMPv3). An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system or to cause a reload of the affected system.  Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the Cisco Group Encrypted Transport VPN (GET VPN) feature of Cisco IOS could allow traffic to bypass the configured encryption policy.  The vulnerability is due to the default, implicit policies set in place to permit Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) traffic to flow unencrypted to allow the GET VPN group members (GMs) to communicate with the GET VPN key servers (KSs). Only transit or to the device traffic using UDP as the transport protocol and port 848 as either the source or destination will bypass the user-defined encryption policies.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) BRIDGE Management Information Base (MIB) of the Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to a faulty implementation of certain SNMP Object Identifiers (OIDs) within the BRIDGE MIB. An SNMP request for certain Object Identifiers (OIDs) within the BRIDGE MIB can cause the device to reload unexpectedly. If an attacker knows the SNMP community string, the attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing an authenticated SNMP request of the BRIDGE MIB OID to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload with each SNMP request, creating a DoS condition.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the DLSw feature of Cisco IOS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to extract information from previously processed packets.  The vulnerability is due to the lack of initialization of packet buffers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the DLSw port (TCP/2067). An exploit could allow the attacker to extract potentially sensitive information, including clear-text passwords and SNMP community strings from previously processed packets.  This vulnerability was reported to Cisco by Tate Hansen and John McLeod of FishNet Security, and Kyle Rainey.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the SNMP implementation of could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to the affected device.  The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the affected code area. The vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP (versions 1, 2c, and 3). The attacker must know the SNMP read only community string (SNMP version 2c or earlier) or the user credentials (SNMPv3). An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system or to cause a reload of the affected system.  Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the implementation of the Cisco IOS Software Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol may cause the anti-replay capabilities of IPsec to be disabled. This issue occurs only when using the Advanced Encryption Standard Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) or the AES Galois Message Authentication Code (AES-GMAC) algorithms for Phase 2 IPsec Security Associations (SAs).  The vulnerability is due to improper coding of the logic required to enable or disable the anti-replay capabilities of an IPsec Phase 2 SA. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic that will traverse an IPsec tunnel. An exploit could allow the attacker to replay previously sent traffic as long as the application consuming the traffic does not implement its own sequence or anti-replay checks. Neither the confidentiality nor the authentication capabilities of IPsec are affected by this vulnerability.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service condition.  The vulnerability exists due to a failure to properly process malformed ICMP messages received on a VRF enabled interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting ICMP messages designed to trigger the issue to an affected device. When processed, the packet queue of the affected interface may not be cleared, leading to a queue wedge. If wedged, the affected device will stop processing further packets received on the wedged interface.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the handling of remote TCP connections in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a partial denial of service (DoS) condition due to low memory.  The vulnerability is due to the handling of out-of-order, or otherwise invalid, TCP packets on a remote connection to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the device and then sending crafted TCP packets that are out of order or have invalid flags. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to report low-memory warnings, which could in turn cause a partial DoS condition. This vulnerability was initially found for Secure Shell Host (SSH) remote connections, but it could also affect other remote connections to the device.</description>

        <reference ref_id="CVE-2013-5473" source="CVE" />
        <description>A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak that could lead to a device reload.  The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of malformed IKE packets by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKE packets to a device configured with features that leverage IKE version 1 (IKEv1).  Although IKEv1 is automatically enabled on a Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software when IKEv1 or IKE version 2 (IKEv2) is configured, the vulnerability can be triggered only by sending a malformed IKEv1 packet.  In specific conditions, normal IKEv1 packets can also cause an affected release of Cisco IOS Software to leak memory.  Only IKEv1 is affected by this vulnerability.  An exploit could cause Cisco IOS Software not to release allocated memory, causing a memory leak. A sustained attack may result in a device reload.</description>

        <description>Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) implementation in Cisco IOS® Software that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device when SIP operation is enabled. Remote code execution may also be possible.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. For devices that must run SIP there are no workarounds; however, mitigations are available to limit exposure of the vulnerabilities.  This advisory is posted at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-sip["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-sip"].  Note: The March 24, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes seven Security Advisories. All the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each advisory lists the releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table at the following URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities that have been published on March 24, 2010, or earlier:  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-bundle["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-bundle"]  Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar10.html["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar10.html"]</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly parse MSDP Source-Active (SA) packets that contain unexpected values. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by creating and injecting an MSDP SA packet designed to trigger the issue. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to restart.</description>

        <description>Cisco IOS software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access and disclose sensitive information.  The vulnerability is due to insecure handling of multicast network traffic. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by initiating a phone call to the affected system. The vulnerability could allow the attacker to monitor ongoing call information between peers when the call is placed on hold.  Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released updated software.  To successfully exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must join the voice call session. To achieve this objective, the attacker may require access to trusted, internal networks. This access limitation could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.  Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</description>

        <description>Cisco IOS and Cisco Catalyst OS contain an integer overflow vulnerability that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause affected devices to stop processing configuration changes, possibly resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  This vulnerability exists due to an integer overflow error within the statistics counters. An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a spoofed VTP summary packet to the affected device, causing the VTP statistics parameter to wrap to a negative number. This condition could prevent the affected device from processing further configuration changes. Under some circumstances, this could prevent the device from responding to further requests, resulting in a DoS  condition.  Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security response and released updated software to correct it.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the local network to spoof the malicious request. Additionally, VTP configurations that use an authentication password within the VTP domain will require the attacker to know the domain password to successfully exploit the vulnerability. Only devices with valid VTP configurations are affected by this vulnerability.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in Cisco devices running IOS Software versions 15.2(04)M6 and 15.4(03)S configured with access control lists (ACLs) could allow an unauthenticated, remote user connected to a tunnel interface to bypass configured ACLs on tunnel interfaces if the ACL on the physical interface permits the traffic to pass.  The vulnerability is due to the physical interface ignoring the tunnel interface ACLs. A user could exploit this vulnerability to bypass configured tunnel interface ACLs and pass denied traffic across tunnel interfaces. If successful, the user could pass traffic as if the ACLs did not exist.</description>

        <description>Cisco IOS Software and Cisco Unified Communications Manager contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to improper processing of malformed packets by the affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious network requests to the targeted system. If successful, the attacker could cause the device to become unresponsive, resulting in a DoS condition.  Cisco confirmed this vulnerability and released software updates.  To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send malicious SIP packets to affected systems. Most environments restrict external connections using SIP, likely requiring an attacker to have access to internal networks prior to an attack. In addition, in environments that separate voice and data networks, attackers may have no access to networks that service voice traffic and allow the transmission of SIP packets, further increasing the difficulty of an exploit.  Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</description>

        <description>Cisco software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on a targeted system.  The vulnerability is in the encryption library used by the vulnerable software. This library allows a portion of an encrypted packet to be sent unencrypted in the following packet. The vulnerability occurs only when IP Security (IPsec) is used, as with VPN environments. If an unauthenticated, remote attacker could access an encrypted session, the attacker could obtain unencrypted packets that would contain information. The attacker may benefit from this information and possibly launch further attacks.  Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to a specific combination of hardware modules and encryption libraries in a targeted device. In many cases, this access may require the attacker to have access to internal, trusted networks. These access requirements may limit the potential of a successful exploit.  A successful exploit requires an attacker to have access to the encrypted packet stream. In addition, the attacker cannot control which packets or what portion of the packet will be subject to this vulnerability. However, there is a potential that the decrypted portion of a packet may contain sensitive information.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Universal Broadband Routers performing IPv6 VPN over Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS; 6VPE) and configured for NetFlow could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a crash of the Parallel Express Forwarding (PXF) process on the Performance Routing Engine (PRE) module.  The vulnerability is due to a race condition that may cause an incorrect pointer to be used during IPv6 deaggregation. An attacker would need to control a trusted MPLS neighbor that can forward a malformed 6VPE packet at a high rate to an affected device. Successful exploitation could cause the PXF process on the PXE module of a targeted device to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the packet driver code of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to how the packet driver code handles packets that belong to protocols that engage high priority queues, such as Virtual Switching Systems (VSS) or Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of BFD or VSS packets to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device that would lead to a DoS condition.</description>

        <description>Cisco 1800 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISR) contain a vulnerability in the hardware entropy collection module when the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Basic Rate Interface (BRI) is configured and connected to a public switched network. This could allow an attacker with knowledge of the ISDN phone number of the affected device to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to an interrupt timer collision that causes the hardware encryption module to enter a corrupted state, causing the device to become unresponsive. An attacker would need to perform the attack exactly when the device polls the hardware encryption module to perform entropy collection.  The affected devices have reached the End of Software Maintenance milestone. Fixed software will not be released.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the processing of IP Detail Record (IPDR) packets on Cisco uBR10000 devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gather a limited amount of IPDR data from the affected device.  The vulnerability is due to the inability of Cisco Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS) to define access control lists (ACLs) specific to the IPDR service to block unauthorized users. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPDR packets requesting that a limited amount of information from an affected CMTS is exported back to the attacker's IP address. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gather a limited amount of IPDR data from the affected device.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the quality of service (QoS) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.  The vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain values in packets that are destined for UDP port 18999 of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with elevated privileges. The attacker could also leverage this vulnerability to cause the device to reload, causing a temporary DoS condition while the device is reloading.  The malicious packets must be destined to and processed by an affected device. Traffic transiting a device will not trigger the vulnerability.</description>

        <description>A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software function that restores encapsulated option 82 information in DHCP Version 4 (DHCPv4) packets could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs incomplete input validation of encapsulated option 82 information that it receives in DHCPOFFER messages from DHCPv4 servers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv4 packet to an affected device, which the device would then forward to a DHCPv4 server. When the affected software processes the option 82 information that is encapsulated in the response from the server, an error could occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

The vulnerabilities are referenced in this document as follows:  SSL/TLS Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability  DTLS Recursion Flaw Vulnerability  DTLS Invalid Fragment Vulnerability  SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability  SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS Session Injection or Denial of Service Vulnerability  Anonymous ECDH Denial of Service Vulnerability  ECDSA NONCE Side-Channel Recovery Attack Vulnerability  Please note that the devices that are affected by this vulnerability are the devices acting as a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) server terminating SSL or DTLS connections or devices acting as an SSL client initiating an SSL or DTLS connection. Devices that are simply traversed by SSL or DTLS traffic without terminating it are not affected.</description>

        <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) feature in Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerabilities are due to the improper parsing of crafted CIP packets destined to an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted CIP packets to be processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>
