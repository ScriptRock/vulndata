        <description>A device running Cisco IOS® Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, or Cisco IOS XR Software is vulnerable to a remote denial of service (DoS) condition if it is configured for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and has support for Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).  A crafted LDP UDP packet can cause an affected device running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software to reload. On devices running affected versions of Cisco IOS XR Software, such packets can cause the device to restart the mpls_ldp process.  A system is vulnerable if configured with either LDP or Tag Distribution Protocol (TDP).  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.  Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.

        <description>Cisco IOS® Software contains a vulnerability when the Cisco IOS SSL VPN feature is configured with an HTTP redirect. Exploitation could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to cause a memory leak on the affected devices, that could result in a memory exhaustion condition that may cause device reloads, the inability to service new TCP connections, and other denial of service (DoS) conditions.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There is a workaround to mitigate this vulnerability.  This advisory is posted at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-sslvpn["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-sslvpn"].  Note: The September 22, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. Five of the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one advisory addresses vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Each advisory lists the releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table at the following URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities that have been published on September 22, 2010, or earlier:  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-bundle["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-bundle"]  Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep10.html["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep10.html"]</description>

        <description>Devices running Cisco IOS® Software and configured for Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express (CME) or Cisco Unified Survivable Remote Site Telephony (SRST) operation are affected by two denial of service vulnerabilities that may result in a device reload if successfully exploited. The vulnerabilities are triggered when the Cisco IOS device processes specific, malformed Skinny Call Control Protocol (SCCP) messages.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is posted at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-cucme["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-cucme"].
